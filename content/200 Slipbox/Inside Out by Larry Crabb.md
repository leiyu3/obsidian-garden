## Summary
Larry Crabb lays out the process necessary to have real change. It is not about behavior or a new commitment to follow Christ, but a deep look inside our hearts. To see where we hurt the most, and that springs us towards God who gives us hope. 

How can we clean the inside instead of just pretending to be okay and good on the outside?

## Key Take Aways
- Real Change Require a Inside look.
- Pain and suffering falls into God's design for us to hope in Him genuinely
- We are thirsty people. Our longings and desires are legitimate. The tricky part is how we handle those longing and desires.
- When we are hurt we become self-protective and that hinders real love.
- The bible is meant to change us, transform us, not to make us big brain. It is suppose to give us a big heart, not just a big brain.
- All spiritual discipline should transform us to Love God more and in consequence love people more.
    - The purpose of devotional is to be transformed
    - The purpose of praying is to have the mind of God
    - The purpose of knowing God is to love God more.
    - The purpose of reading books is to know God and learn to Love God, and love people

## Preface to the 25th Anniversary Edition
Many people seek God for the good that God can provide. They want to live the life they want to live. They don't seek God, to get more of God. In the end they are self seeking.

Vending Machine Christianity. Put in an ethical coin and get blessings.

Do we only tilth if we know that we will have left overs? Do we only follow God because we know we will be well off after?

The Managed Life, The Blessed Life, The Wounded, The Healed Life.
Relational Holiness

Jesus lived an abundant life through pain, suffering, abandonment, loss...

>     Because of the other-centered life of Jesus, because of the self-sacrificing death of Jesus, and because of the life giving resurrection of Jesus, we can now live the Abundant Life of Jesus, which centers on a way of relating to God and others that is energized by the other-centeredness, self-sacrificing, and life-giving passion of Jesus

The Forming Life, The Abundant Life

## Preface to the 2007 Edition
Don't be afraid of sadness, don't be afraid of brokenness. Let them lead to you the hope in Christ Jesus.

Can anyone love me as I am? Broken, selfish, self-rightous...

The practice of psychology sees people with mental disorders, so they treat them medically. But we are sinful people, that is our number 1 problem. And sin is the root of all our problem...

There more we look inside and see our brokenness, the more grace becomes appetizing.

## Introduction: The False Hope of Modern Christianity

Christian life has shifted from knowing and serving God in the present life, to soothing or ignoring our pain until He arrives

We have been told that Christ can eliminate all pain and suffering. So it isn't necessary to wrestle with pain and struggles, just trust and obey.

But this only masks the reality that we live as broken people in a broken world. We don't really feel the joy that we pretend to have... We live in denial.

Aching soul is a sign of realism. We are longing for something greater in the future.

Sometimes our spiritual disciplines and desire for maturity is just a means to cover up or ignore the brokenness within ourselves and the world.

We like it when we know that there is a solution to a problem. If the solution is to spend more time in the word and I would feel better, then great! I can do it. But if the solution is to depend on another, then we get a little hesitant.

Modern Christianity says that "something we can do" can let us achieve a level of spirituality that will remove the pain, the guilt, the struggles of life.

Digging our own wells when we are thirsty. With church leaders tell us where to dig. With the expectation that it will quench all our thirst.

Why am I doing what I am doing?

We need to be realistic about the struggles that we and others are having. Or else we are also telling the meta-narrative that everything is going well, we can pave our own path.

We are perverts for independence...

Appreciation of the past and hope for the future as stability for the present? For what had happened on the cross, and the expectation of His second coming.

Our want for "Now!" has shifted our focus off the coming Christ who would make all things new. To a counterfeit

Not about "relief" but about "change". God wants to change us, He doesn't simply want us to be content where we are. That's probably the worse that can happen to someone, is to be perfectly happy where they are.
- Where to find contentment then?

Producing "Little Christs" [[./Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis|Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis]]

## Part One: Looking Beneath the Surface of Life
### Chapter 1: Real Change Requires An Inside Look

The Four Audiences of this book
1. Those that tried to follow the bible, but nothing changes.
2. Those that are doing well. -> There is more!
3. Those are aren't doing well, and given up. Hardened.
4. Those in church leader ship. You don't have to place distance to appear more holy.

What does it mean to change? How would you feel? Would you feel more joy? Or would you feel more of your sinfulness? Or are people just pretending? What kind of change is possible?

#### The Appearance of Maturity: Looking Good

When everyone else (especially those said to be "Mature") looks good, like their life is in order. You feel like you don't belong, especially you don't feel like how everyone else looked.

Some seems to handle difficult situation well, and other seems to not. Are those that do well, just pretending? What makes them different?

Same may very well have it together and have what it takes to face difficulties. But what about the rest? Are they just in denial? Are they just out of touch?

#### The Way Things are Beneath the Appearance

Since the fall, things are out of place. Things feel wrong. We hide from others, from God.

We try to cope. Eating, service, TV, change our image... (building our house on the sand)

We *rearrange* rather than *change*.

> [!NOTE] A thought
> I'm thinking if people that jokes a lot are actually suffering a lot and using humour to hide their pain. If that's the case then those who laugh the most, are actually those that are struggling the most....
> But what about joy? Is joy the same as laughing and joking?


We need to go into the sewers and really clean it out. Go inside our hearts and really figure out how we have been coping, and change from the inside so that the outside can be clean as well.

#### Can I Make it If I Face it?
We fear what's inside, and it is legitimate fear. But we got so good at denial that we are bad at noticing spiritual deterioration.

Pharisees are prime example of this. They make outer appearance the sign of maturity, while their inside are filth.

Matthew 23:25-26
Hosea 7:9

No place for pretence, Christ requires us to look inside and clean it up.

#### Shallow Copers versus Troubled Reflectors

Two type of people
1) Those that successfully cope
2) Those that live with a troubled heart

Obedience is good, but it can shift the focus to something unhealthy. Such as only cleaning up the outside. Not consuming certain content and attending church every Sunday. Instead of focusing on fixing relationships (with people and with God)...
- we focus too much on external growth not internal growth
"I'm attending church regularly I'm doing better" -> stuff like that

When our commitment to obedience to God, is just a guise to cope with our struggles, and not a passionate desire to follow God.

### Chapter 2: An Inside Look Can be Frustrating

There is two kind of change:
1. External Change that comes from discipline (pattern of behavior)
    - having more willpower to take care of their health, sticking to an diet etc..
    - *Do* better, or doing good
    - *effective, disciplined, nice*
2. Internal Change that relates to character qualities
    - harder to change
    - *Be* better, or being good
    - *noble, godly, rich*

How do we work out our salvation? Dependence on God? Effort?

Learning more and obey. Does not produce an internal change necessarily, but more of the outward behavioural change. What God wants is a change of heart that can genuinely love God and  others.

Learning to love properly will solve our problem psychologically.

Action, Thoughts, Feeling -> responsibility with effort
Motives, Urges, Memories, Attitudes -> requires a heart change

Some options (though not complete) have been given to change those that's below the water line:
1. Do Your Christian Duties
    - Serve, read your bible, pray...
    - May end up "rigid, well disciplined distant Christians who do right but relate poorly" <- that's me
    - everything right, except for **a man of love**
        - and without love, all the "good" we do is nothing
    - Work hard and the "goodness" will seep down
2. Depend on the special work of the Holy Spirit
    - just believe harder?
    - just trust harder, have more faith?
    - Just let the Holy Spirit do the work
3. Work through obstacles for growth
    - notice the first 2 options does not require us to work directly with the issues below the water line
    - counseling
    - transformation as "working through deep problems" but doesn't focus on "repenting of deep sin"
        - does not directly deal with spiritual issues
    - Leaves God as peripheral
    - self-preoccupation 

How do we change on the inside?


It's okay to hurt. 

Having it all put together isn't sign of maturity.

Casual: filled with food, material, etc.
c : satisfied by other people.
crucial desire: ones that only God can fill

Change needs to start with the crucial desires being filled, then overflowing to critical, and then casual.

Looking inside makes us face our emotions, and longings and it should lead to us to God to satisfy them in the future.

Faith, hope, and love.

## Part 3:
### Looking in All the Wrong Places
Sometimes our commitment to follow Christ only contain the *fruit* of commitment but not the *core* of commitment. The core require change form the inside. While the fruit is usually just the outward behavioural change (I will not listen, look, at this thing no more...etc.. and I will do this more..)

How do we know that our internal's are clean? Isn't it enough to declear that you want to change on the inside and the do the external act?

Problem of sin in 2 parts:
1. All the visible act of sin
2. Subtle violation of God's command to love

A bad understanding of the second part, lead to too much focus on the first part. And we become pharisees. We focus so much on what not to do/what to do that.

We need to find out why we end up doing the wrong, and not doing the right. From a perspective of loving people correctly; relating to people correctly.

The sin of self-protection: Not talking about avoiding pain physically and emotionally. But when our desire to be loved, makes us avoid pain in a way that we are not loving to people as we should be. 
- subtle
- often disguises as good christian characteristics


The more mature we are the more wonderfully unique our way of relating would be. Maturity does not be homogenizing (There isn't one ideal way to relate).

*We tend to relate to others in ways to avoid things that we are self-protective about*

The mark of maturity is love, and the esense of love is without self protection
we associate struggle with introspection and godliness with outward appearance
we are demanding people. we demand when we are frustrated
1) recognize we are creatures 2) remind ourself of God's love
- let it mature you instead of growing in demanding

*The Gospel According to Job* by Mike Mason

Our initial faithful response to trials might be us trying to prove to God we're mature and learned the lessons. "Let's make it easy for me now"

It is okay tohurt and to thirst, but not demand (morality of pragmatism)

Our *personality* can be "harder to recognize sins"

It is hard and difficult to hear the diagnose of cancer. It is easy to diagnose in the surface level. But a cure can't happen if we don't diagnose properly.

God provide three source of light to look inside:
1. The Spirit of God
2. The Word of God
3. The people of God
- three legged stool

#### The Spirit of God
Alone time in meditation with God's word.
We hide beneath our self-deceit. Only God can uncover.
The *searching* of the Spirit (Psalm 139)

The plank in our own eyes is often small when compared to another person's specks. Our focus in prayer/meditation often shifts into another person's sin, to shift focus away from our own.
- Pain in looking at our own sin

Another obstacle is that we don't set our goal to be changed. If we don't plan to be changed we won't do the hard work of being changed. We are too comfortable (we are making it a priority). We need to set our goal to be conformity to Christ. We become complacent in our circumstances, rather than resting in Christ's promises and works.
- comfort making us feel like change is not needed

Rest removes anxiousness to live life as I **should**, but still drives me to know God and wants other to know Him as well.

Lacedian, lukewarm in the way we relate to others

#### The Word of God

How can some study the word so much that they become more distance and less loving towards people? Remaining unchanged. Love for truth, and orthodoxy, but not love for people.

The problem is getting what is in our heads into our hearts. Just the content/knowledge won't do, it has to penetrate deep into our hearts.

"Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up" (1 Corinthians 8:1)
- is your reason to read the scripture to gain knowledge only?

It is important to study the Scripture, but scholarship is not the end goal. It must impact our life.

If all God wanted was to give us facts and knowledge then He would have written the bible differently. It would be structured like a systematic theology book.

The bible is relational, personal. (Paul wrote personal letters..)

Study, engage with the word, listen to sermons, take notes, read commentaries *all for the purpose of better knowing God, yourself, and others so you become more loving.*

*We must comes to the Bible with the purpose of self-exposure consciously in mind*
- asking the "right' questions, the ones that allows us to see ourself more clearly
- we also must understand how people work

#### The People of God
- *to give feedback lovingly* and to *receive feedback nondefensively*
- Word of God present the idea, the spirit of God shines light, and the people of God points to specific concern that need attention.
- two options when relating with one another
    - remain comfortably distance
        - masked faith
    - open a can of worm
        - the risk is worth it, and commanded
        - become vulnerable

*Remember that honest sharing is not the final goal, love is*. 
- don't share things that have nothing to do with the person's well being
- in the development of a relationship much needs to be left unsaid
- love will restrain me from saying what I judge may hurt you needlessly
- sharing must be limited not by self-protection but by sensitive love

*Good fellowship is characterized by support and kindness, not by confrontation*
- understanding deep longings
- feel the mood of the group
    - is it cold, and people are looking out for each other's sin?
    - or does it feel empty, and not much sharing is being done?

*Meaningful involvement must precede efforts to expose each other's sin*
- the person doing the feedback is important, someone who are involved in the person's life

- the group needs to know their purpose
    - deep longing and self-protection
- a framework
- a method
    - bible study
    - book study
    - topical
    - members sharing about their life up to the present. (major joy and disappointments etc..)
    - *the commitment to evaluate what happens as the group interacts*
- a leader
    - personal integrity (a willingness to look deeply inside one's own life)
    - compassionate sensitivity (a character quality that develops by facing one's own pain and learning to commit it to the Lord)
    - some awareness of how people function

- be patients when you want to start a group like this. It's a rocky path

## Part Four Changing from the Inside Out
### 10 Defining the Problem
We live in a fallen world, so something really is wrong.

To find the cure, we need to clearly define the problem.

#### Facing Our Sin

When we fail to take an inside look and try to get "practical" prematurely, we only end up making superficial changes.

A serious inside look would bring us a lot of pain, and would lead to us to Christ.

Change is less about what we should do, but more about understanding what is going on inside us
- How do we use books like [[../../Thoughts for Young Men by J.C. Ryle|Thoughts for Young Men by J.C. Ryle]] and [[./Discipline of a Godly Man by R. Ken Hughs|Discipline of a Godly Man by R. Ken Hughs]] then?

#### Embracing the Mystery

The process of change remains a mystery
The man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know. 1 Cor 8:2
The more you know, the more you realize you don't know.
Does it produce Christlike character or Christlike behavior?
- behavior -> what one thinks a Christ should act like..

We will never figure out the mechanics of change

#### Accepting the Process
Change is a process, not a one time and done deal.

Focus on progress
Focus on Christ's redeeming work
There's always more work to be done

Everyone is in the process, no one is completely sanctified

#### Sin in our Hearts
We are both victum and culprits
We are sinned against in a fallen world, and also sinned against others.
We've been sinned against and we sin.

#### What Needs to Be Changed?
1. Problems in our world
2. Pain in our heart
3. Sin in our behavior
4. **Sin in our heart**

Problems in our world and pain in our heart is not what we need to change.
What we need to change is the sin that we choose to do.
Sin in our behavior is a problem, but it is a symptom of a bigger problem. Sin in the heart.

The heart is deceitful. We often fool ourself with just the outward behavioral change, and are blind to the way we are self-protecting.

#### The Value of Entering our Disappointment
The more deeply we can feel our disappointment we more deeply we can face our sin.

"When someone appreciates his parents only because he overlooks the pain they caused him, his appreciation is not only superficial but also self-protective."

- Love is never blind to others' faults.
- It sees them clearly but is not threatened.
- It admits disappointment but forgives and continues to be warmly involved.

When we see clearly how other has failed us, it breaks down the demand that they love us well.
- allows us to appreciate what they do give
- resentment grows out of demandiness

We have been disappointed by other's ability to love us. But God love us perfectly, and that allows us to love as well.

### 11 The Power of the Gospel

Can change really happen? 
Does change only qualify as change if it is changed to the full? (Why settle for less when God is at work?)

Does the bible promise those changes?
- Does God only promise to support us during those struggles? or eliminate those struggles?

All struggle and pain will be eliminated one day, but that's not untill the second coming.

There would be unnessary problem that develop when we insist that necessary pain be eliminated.

There are necessary pains. If we define change as elimination of inevitable struggle, they will have so much un-necessary pain and disappointments.

#### Unnecessary Problems Versus Necessary Responses

When Adam first sinned his response was to cover him self. 
To uncover self-protection, to look inside and not run away from it seems very hard.
Real change can be ours, just not the ones that heaven promises.

The demandiness for the relief of pain is the dirt on the inside.
This develop self-protection relation patterns that is designed to protect us from the world.

It is necessary that we hurt but it is un-necessary that we become less loving and less powerful people.

The present power of the gospel isn't to create a warmth that overcome all struggle and pain but one that helps us to overcome a demanding spirit and replace it with trust as we await the full revelation of its power -> that we will one day be with God in heaven.

#### Dealing with Disappointing Events (Problems in Our World)
- Critical longings are legitimate and we deal with them through prayer and biblical principles

#### Dealing with Necessary Pain (Pain in Our Heart)
- harder
- requires a inside look
- most solution depend on numbing the pain instead of facing the pain

#### Dealing with Obvious Sin (Sin in Our Behavior)
- just changing our behavior is not enough, we should still do it but it alone is not enough

#### Dealing with Relational Sin (Sin in the Heart)
- repent
- the more authentic I become the more vulnerable I become
- Understanding the ugliness of sin
- finding out how we have been self-protecting and moving into more authentic less-self protecting way of relating

Hosea 14:1-3 -> How to Repent
- Return to the Lord your God
    - Eternal life is knowing God
    - all our effort should lead us closer to God 
    - from self dependence to dependence on God
- Take words with you
    - have clear idea of what we are repenting of
    - the more we understand our sin the more complete our repentence
- Forgive all our sins
    - repentance is made possible with the forgiveness of God
- Receive us graciously, that we may offer the fruit of our lips
    - we so often decide to do better or commit ourself to the Lord with the wrong motive
        - "I'm been feeling depressed"
    - True repentance is motivated by a heart that wants to worship and know God more deeply
- Assyria cannot save us; we will not mount war-horses
    - don't rely on self protection to save us
    - rely on God to protect us
- We will never again say "Our gods" to what our own hands have made
    - instead of relying on ourselves, digging our own well rely on God
- In you the fatherless find compassion
    - we will find compassion in the Father's love

### 12 What It Takes to Deeply Change

How deep do we look inside?

Spiritual Depth
- assurance when discouragement is oppressive
- designed to love even in *this* situation

Inside look should encourage spiritual depth, as we sense our thirst, it moves/motivates us towards water.

Change is progressive
- change in our conscious
- change in our approach to relationship
- change in the direction of our very being

#### Change in Our Conscious Direction
- change in what you want to do with your life
- change in lifestyle
- eg: rock musician to ministry
- A basic grasp of the gospel
    - Understanding that we sinned, wages of sin is death, the graph of God can only be received and not earned, we are saved by God to live a holy life
- 

#### Change in Our Approach in Relationships
- *How life is to be live* and *how we missed the mark*
- an inside look is required to change our approach in relationship
    - To see how we've been let down, and what we are doing to protect ourself from further disappointment
- as we see how we are self protecting, we can repent of them and act in love instead of self-protection
- from self-protection to loving-involvement

#### Change in the Direction of Our Being
- from idolatry to worship
- For this level of change we need to understand 2 things:
    1. Since the fall every male struggles to regard himself as fully male, and every female fail to regard herself as fully female
        - God created male and female and they are different
            - man: one who remembers and moves, God's grace filled movement
            - women: one who is open to received,  God's grace filled invitation
        - When sin came, work became hard and Adam/men is threatened, as a person designed to provide for another
        - Eve can not count on Adam to perfectly respond in love, Eve have to be come tough to handle the reality that Adam is not a perfect partner. She is threatened because she is designed to find joy in accepting and embracing others, but now feel compelled to control her relationships
        - Since all the above have been threatened, sexual pleasure became the evidence of our sexual identity and no longer an *expression* of our sexuality
            - sinful sexual expression
                - to provide a counterfeit, momentary sense of maleness or femaleness
    2. Life between the fall of man and the coming of Christ is so overwhelmingly sad that only our hope in Christ can preserve us from insanity or suicide
        - most of live is designed to ignore the horror of the world, most unbeliever and nominal Christian lives an pretty good life
            - but this undermines the Cross of Christ and the Second Coming of Christ, and the communion
            - But life as we know it really isn't that good, or even how it should have been.
            - It is only when we deeply feel the brokenness of the world that we can flee to  God. Or else we are just sugar coating things.
- I am threatened as a man or women as I live in a world where there is nothing desirable apart form God. But because of Christ, I will into my world with all the energy of my manhood or womanhood.
- People can be drawn to God, when you make those positive changes.

### 13 The "Good Stuff" Beneath the Bad
#### Painful Cure
Trial by fire, change is extremely painful.

But as many things the hard thing is the easy thing, and the easy thing becomes the hard thing.
- bitter medicine, painful chemotherapy
- labor proceed birth
- life after death

Sometimes the pain is so severe, so painful, so nuanced, that self-protection seems like a virtue 

#### Something Wonderful

We are more than our pain and sufferings. There is something good that God has placed in us.

#### Releasing the New Life Within
1. **surrender** to God
2. Inside look in the **safety** of community
3. Develop the spiritual sensitivity to listen to God as He leads
    - silence, prayer, meditation, solitude, fasting

### 14 So Much More
Enjoying God can only come when hopelessness is gained, when we look at no other direction.

Psalm 73

The path to a changed life is hard, but worth it.

Does being a Christian make life easier or more difficult? More hurt or blessings?
Is it easier to just live a life of ease, without looking inside and seeking real change?
Life without God is not life, they all go toward destruction.

Ethernal life now.
God sees us, notices us, forgives us, and appreciates us.
