Christians should read, believe, and obey the bible. It is important that we understand what God is trying to say to us.

- 2 Timothy 3:16, All Scripture is God Breathed and Profitable for every good works.
	- This is how we know God as He has revealed Himself
	- It is Good for us
- Psalm 1:1-2
	- Those that meditates and delights in his word are blessed.
	- In all that he does, he prospers
- It is how we discern between the voice of the Holy Spirit and voice of others (the voice of Satan, the voice of your deceitful heart)
