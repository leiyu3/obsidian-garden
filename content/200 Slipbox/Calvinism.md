This always comes up some how.

The Calvinism vs [[./Arminianism|Arminianism]] debate.

I think Calvinism is right because, when given the choice between God's sovereignty and Man's free will. God sovereignty always wins.

Either way you will have a "logical" inconsistency. Which I believe actually comes from our pre supposition that: God's Sovereignty and Man's free will couldn't co exists.

But I think the Scripture clearly shows that God is sovereign over all things, even man kind. But man is still responsible for their own actions, especially their actions regarding salvation. And the bible doesn't think there is a logical paradox with that. That is kind of clearly implied.

- **God is sovereign**
- **Man are responsible for their own actions.**

Calvinist believe that God has already predestined people to be saved. Romans 9 talk a lot about this. There are also many placed in the old testament where it mentions that the Israelites are God's chosen people. God chose Israel not because the Israelites where some how superior to other nations. It is just God's grace.

Some people also argue that if God can save everyone and God loves everyone and wants everyone to be saved, then why didn't God predestine everyone to be saved? It is a hard question to answer, and I think it is mostly a mystery to us. But if God's is good, and God is wise, His wisdom is so much higher than ours. Perhaps this is actually the best world, by not saving everyone. Which is very weird to think about. But we are finite being and we don't know everything. 


If God is Sovereign and Good then why does He allow bad things to happen? [[../../Theodicy|Theodicy]]

- is God not just/good for saving everyone?
	- No, because God would be completely justified and good that everyone perishes
- Why would God create a world that have evil? or a place where Hell is possible?
	- Why doesnt' God just make everyone believe in Him?
		- Then there wouldn't be real love
	- Why doesn't God save everyone?
		- God still gives them a choice
	- Ultimately it is God who chooses, but God still give people responsibility
