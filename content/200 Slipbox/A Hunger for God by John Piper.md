title: A Hunger for God
---

Fasting is very counter cultural in the west

Fasting is not often talked about in the west
And so there is a lot of confusion and misconceptions about fasting


> [!Quote] J I Packer
> When Christians meet, they talk to each other about their Christian work and Christian interests, their Christian acquaintances, the state of the churches, and the problems of theology—but rarely of their daily experience of God.
> 

Do we earnestly seek God or do we just earnestly seek after things from God?

Psalm 34:8

Don't make fasting legalistic 1 Timothy 4:1-3, Col 2:20-21

Fast so that our desire for God is greater. Fast because God is greater then these things (food). Fast so that we recognize God is greater than food.

Fasting because of homesickness for God
Like the yearning to get married

Fast because our hunger for God is greater than hunger for food.

Fast is resisted when hunger for other things is greater. We fight our physical appetite through fasting.

It is often the good things (God's gift) that kept us away from enjoying Him.

Fasting is not just about food but anything that can become a substitute for God.

Abraham chose God over his one and only son Issac.

> [!Quote] C.S. Lewish (The problem with Pain)
> I am concerned with the question] “If God is omniscient he must have known what Abraham would do, without any experiment; why, then, this needless torture?” But as St. Augustine points out, whatever God knew, Abraham at any rate did not know that this obedience would endure such a command until the event taught him; and the obedience which he did not know that he would choose, he cannot be said to have chosen. The reality of Abraham’s obedience was the act itself; and what God knew in knowing that Abraham “would obey” was Abraham’s actual obedience on that mountain top at that moment. To say that God “need not have tried the experiment” is to say that because God knows, the thing known by God need not exist. 

What ever God knew must have to have happened for it to be true [[./Predestination|Predestination]] Omniscience

God wants to know the real stuff. Not an "imagined" world.

How can we know that we love God unless we are being out to the test?

Fasting gives us opportunities to test our love for God.

Fasting is a test that shows what controls us

We all have things that help us "cope"

God created food, hunger, water and thirst so that we may understand John 6:35. Created for the glory of Christ Colossians 1:16

When we eat we glorify God what food symbolizes. When we fast we glorify God by saying we prefer the reality over the symbols.

The more we taste and see that God is good the more we will hunger for God.

> [!Quote] C.S. Lewis
> Our havings are wantings

If you have little wanting for God it doesn't mean you are satisfied with God but that you are okay with the worldly stuff.

## Fasting For The Little Ones
- Abortion causes one of the most moral deterioration of the modern world. As it allows mothers to kill their own child.

## Conclusion: Why does God Reward Fasting?
- Matthew 6:18

- Fasting for the glory of God.
