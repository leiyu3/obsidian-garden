## Review
There were some good stuff about joy, but there was also a big chunk of it probably half of it that I wanted to skip. There's probably better stuff to read about joy.

## Notes
- The Bible is a book of joy
- God means for Christianity to be fun
- Christians should be people of Joy
- Many of the joyfulness of the bible has been down played, partially due to translators wanting to make the words better for "solumn worship"
	- Greek word for "hiraros" hilarious -> cheerful
	- Chairos (be full of joy) -> hail or farewell
- Salvation is joyful
- We like the Israelites in the wilderness has forgotten the joy when God delivered us from our captors, and are now complaining and grumbling and maybe even worshipping our own golden calfs.
- Obstacles to our joy: sin, stress, pain, and adversity
- Salvation might hold, but the joy of it might be gone because of sin
- Sometimes stress is a mountain that not need to be climbed
- Adversity is sin, stress, pain and more
- If you joy is not there in adversity, then your joy is shallow
- God made creation in joy
- Oil and joy goes together in the bible. 
- Today oil and joy work similarly, one in the physical and one in the spiritual
	- Oil makes things run smoothly, oil reduces strain
	- Joy makes living easier and better
- Joy helps in witnessing
- The word "Blessed" in the beatitude can be translated to "take joy!"
- You don't keep joy but joy keeps us
- God is a God of Joy, He is Himself Joyy
- We are to reflect the joy of God
- Jesus came to bring glad tidings of salvation
