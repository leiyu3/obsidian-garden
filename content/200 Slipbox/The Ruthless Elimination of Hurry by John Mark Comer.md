## Thoughts When Reading
Maybe we have been running our lives with the wrong metric for success. 

We have become human doings instead of human being. 

What does it mean to just '[[To Be|Be]]'?

> [!QUOTE] [[../../Dust by Kings Kaleidoscope|Dust by Kings Kaleidoscope]]
> But you freed me so I can just be
> Nothing to prove, nothing to lose

- I feel like pride is one reason why we go toward hurry. We think that we run the world.
- The purpose of a retreat is to slow down. But it kinda felt hectic for me because I had to lead worship...

Reminds of the book [[./Crazy Busy by Kevin DeYoung|Crazy Busy by Kevin DeYoung]]

There is whole with [[Mental Health|mental health]] as well. We used to have a lot of mundane activity, so that your mind wonders and that wondering actually allows your brain time to process emotions. Now days everything is so stimulating that our brain have no time to slow down, and just breath, and process emotion that it has stop doing that and even worse forgotten how to do that. So now you get a bunch of people with mental health issues but then they escape toward more stimulation and never really let themselves feel or process their emotions. Which is why people are having problem sleeping at night, because that is the only time your brain actually have time to slow down and process those emotions and feelings.

It's interesting because in Mark, Jesus was moving really fast.

Trying to rush devotion (bible reading, and prayer) just to get it checked off for the day. Turns out isn't a solution, but a symptom of a problem of hurry. [[../../Be Alone with God|Be Alone with God]]

Not hurrying is also becoming in the likeness of Christ. God doesn't experience time. So he never hurries. He does everything at the right time. [[God is Above Time|God is Above Time]]

What songs does the book reminds you of?
Not In a hurry 
Dust
Most of it
Seek Your Kingdom

## Book Notes
- Be holy because the days are evil (Ephesians 5:16)

> [!QUOTE]- Matthew 11:28-30
> Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

- Who I want to become: wise, not pretentious or stuck up, joyful, easygoing, comfortable in his own skin, kind curious, present to you and the moment.
- The Downward Spiral of Hurry [[./Parable of the Soil|Parable of the Soil]]
	- Busyness and hurry -> God becoming marginalized -> Repeat
- Hurry and love does not match [[../../Discipleship|Discipleship]]
- Our values are wrong in God's Kingdom, **Hurry is of the devil and slow is of Jesus**
- You can do more with God and without hurry
- Hurry distracts us from the reality of God

### A brief history of speed

- The monks invented the clock in the 12th century to make sure people prayed! [[../../History|History]] [^1]
- Then in 1879 you had Edison and the light bulb, which made it possible to stay up past sunset. 
	- before Edison the average person slept eleven hours a night [[../../New Innovation New Problems|New Innovation New Problems]]

- Walking -> Cars
- Home made food -> takeout
- Hand written letter -> Email -> AI

-  [[../../Technology|Technology]] exploits you for your attention for a financial and political agenda 
	- [[The Shallows by Nicholas G. Carr|The Shallows by Nicholas G. Carr]]
	- If it is free, you are the product! (Attention for ads)
	- What is technology doing to us? What is it making us become?

- [[Brave New World|Brave New World]], he envisioned a future dystopia not of dictatorship but of distraction, where sex, entertainment, and busyness tear apart the fabric of society. (Brave New world got it right not [[./1984 by George Orwell|1984 by George Orwell]])

- After millennia of slow, gradual acceleration, in recent decades the sheer velocity of our culture has reached an exponential fever pitch.
- What is all this distraction, addiction, and pace of life doing to our souls? [[../../Technology|Technology]]

### Something is deeply wrong
- Waiting for your souls to catch up with your bodies.
- [[../../Hurry Sickness|Hurry Sickness]]
	- A behavior pattern characterized by continual rushing and anxiousness. 
	- A malaise in which a person feels chronically short of time, and so tends to perform every task faster and to get flustered when encountering any kind of delay. 
	- Meyer Friedman: A continuous struggle and unremitting attempt to accomplish or achieve more and more things or participate in more and more events in less and less time.
- You may have [[../../Hurry Sickness|Hurry Sickness]] if you...:
	- Moving from one check-out line to another because it looks shorter/faster. 
	- Counting the cars in front of you and either getting in the lane that has the least or is going the fastest. 
	- Multi-tasking to the point of forgetting one of the tasks
	1. Irritability
	2. Hypersensitivity
	3. Restlessness 
	4. Workaholism
	5. Emotional numbness 
	6. Out-of-order priorities
	7. Doing the urgent, and not the important ([[../../Eisenhower Matrix|Eisenhower Matrix]])
	8. Lack of care for your body 
	9. Escapist behaviours [[./Psychology|Psychology]]
	10. Slippage of spiritual disciplines
- Dangers of [[../../Hurry Sickness|Hurry Sickness]]:
	- Isolation
	- wisdom comes from patience and calm
	- loss of attention
	- Our loss of God's presence

### Hint: the solution isn’t more time
- When we have more time, we just spend it on other things
- Our limits:
	- Our Gifting 
	- Our families of origin
	- Our time on earth 
- **We find God’s will for our lives in our limitations**  [[../../Knowing God's Will|Knowing God's Will]]
- Life is a series of choices. [[../../Opportunity Cost|Opportunity Cost]]
	- Don't let the good distract you from the best
- live deliberately with focus and intention
	- being present

### The secret of the easy yoke
- Yoke means "ways of life".
- To be a follower of Jesus means to follow His ways of life. [[../../Discipleship|Discipleship]]
	- his practices, habits
- Jesus promised his followers "Life...to the full" [[../../Eternal Life|Eternal Life]]
- yoke
	- life is work
	- life will be easy with Christ in it
- app
	- am I redeeming my time
	- am I yoked with Christ?

### What we’re really talking about is a rule of life

> [!QUOTE] Stephen Covey (7 Highly Habits of Highly Effective People)
> We achieve inner peace when our schedule is aligned with our values
- what would Jesus do in my position?
- living your life for Jesus instead of making time out for Jesus
- [[../../Time Tracking|Time Tracking]] as an experiment to see how much time you spend on things, what doesn't get tracked doesn't get managed
- [[../../The Four Gospels|The Four Gospels]] are Biographies, which tells us Jesus' way of life 

### Silence and solitude
- Learn to be bored, to draw our minds’ attention (and, with it, devotion) back to God
- Jesus goes away into the desert (a quiet place) before he starts his ministry.
	- Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness” because it was there, and only there, that Jesus was at the height of his spiritual powers. It was only after a month and a half of prayer and fasting in the quiet place that he had the capacity to take on the devil himself and walk away unscathed.
- Jesus often get up early in the morning and goes off somewhere alone to pray.
- Jesus knew what the will of the Father is, and that led Him to know what to say yes to and what to say no to.

- Our mind is constant running with thoughts, and constantly being bombarded with other people's agendas

- [[../../Be Alone with God|Solitude]] is different from isolation or [[./Loneliness|Loneliness]]

- [[../../Be Alone with God|Solitude]] is when you set aside time to feed and water and nourish your soul. To let it grow into health and maturity.
	- [[./Loneliness|Loneliness]] is what you crave when you neglect the former
- We do not take the spiritual life seriously if we do not set aside some time to be  [[../../Be Alone with God|with God]] and listen to him 

- We feel distant from God and end up living off somebody else’s spirituality, via a podcast feed or book or one-page devotional we read before we rush out the door to work.
- [[./Loneliness#Be Alone with God Solitude|We lose sight of our selves]]. We lose sight of our identities and callings. We get sucked into the tyranny of [[../../Eisenhower Matrix|the urgent, and not the important]]

- When we are alone we face the good, the bad, and the ugly in our own hearts.
- Alone. In the quiet. With God. And our souls.

### Sabbath
- Because we're designed for the [[../../God is Infinity|Infinite]], nothing on this earth can satisfy us.

> [!Quote] [[../../The Confessions by Saint Augustine|The Confessions by Saint Augustine]]
> You have made us for yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.

- Advertising monetizes our restlessness. 
- The word Sabbath comes to us from the Hebrew *Shabbat* literally meaning “to stop.”
- Rest is hard work, you have to fight and protect it.
- Once you work a certain number of hours in a week, your productivity plummets.
- God blessed the Sabbath to be life giving. (Genesis 2:3)
- Study have found that the Seventh-day Adventists, who are religious about the Sabbath actually live longer lives
- We can experience God in time, unlike other gods that are worshiped in physical space
- Sabbath is rest and worship
- The Sabbath reminds us that God is the main character in the world, and not me. 
- The Sabbath is not the same as a day off
- The Sabbath is the only "spiritual discipline" that made it in the Ten Commandments

#### Command two: Sabbath as resistance 
- Before the Israelites cross over to Canaan, Moses says to “observe” the Sabbath
- Egypt, exploiting of cheap labor to generate wealth. It is still happening today. And never resting.
- Few Christian owned businesses are still practicing sabbath by closing on Sunday (Chick-fil-a, Chris Jerk)
- On the Sabbath: Don’t buy. Don’t sell. Don’t shop. Don’t surf the web. Don’t read a magazine


### Simplicity
- It is often the good things that steers our heart away from God, especially wealth.
- We sabotage ourselves thinking that the more we have the happier we will be.
- We are now a consumer society where our identity and meaning in life from what we consume.
- Lifestyle bloggers are the priests and priestesses of our days
- The culture is filled with people spending money they don’t have on things they don’t need (to impress people they don't like)
- Advertisement is a form of propaganda that caters to our wants and fears
- Some study indicates that as a nation's wealth goes up, happiness goes down
- [[../../The Progress Paradox|The Progress Paradox]]: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse
1. we put no limit on stuff due to our insatiable human desire for more.
2. we think we need all sorts of things to be happy when, in actuality, we need very few. (I had this thought last year. Is our desire for things, coveting?)
- After reaching a certain income, happiness does not improve when you earn more
- More stuff not only cost money but also time
- In Jesus’ day, if people said you had a “healthy” eye, it had a double meaning. It meant that (1) you were focused and living with a high degree of intentionality in life, and (2) you were generous to the poor [[./Exegesis|Exegesis]]
- We worry about what we worship. If you worship money, it will eat you alive. (sinking sand. money could be gone tomorrow, car could break down any time)
- Strive for simple living
- We want to intentionally promote things that we value and remove things that distract us from our values
- Clutter: Anything that does not add value to my life, or "Spark Joy"
- For believers our values should of those of Jesus's and his kingdom.

1. Before you buy something, ask yourself, What is the true cost of this item?
	 1. What will this do to the pace of my life? Speed it up or slow it down? 
2. Before you buy, ask yourself, By buying this, am I oppressing the poor or harming the earth?
3. Never impulse buy.
4. When you do buy, opt for fewer, better things.
5. When you can, share.

10. Cultivate a deep appreciation for the simple pleasures.
11. Recognize advertisement as propaganda, call out its lies.
	- happiness does not come from things
12. Lead a cheerful, happy revolt against the spirit of materialism.
	 - Embrace the phrase, "Less is better!"
	 -  Cut down on your wardrobe
-  Dallas Willard, "the cost of discipleship is high, but the cost of non-discipleship is even higher"

### Slowing
- Try to live more proactively than reactively
- Try fasting

- Ways to gamify slowing down:
1. Drive the speed limit.
	 - Driving is a great time to pray.
2. Get in the slow lane
3. Come to a full stop at stop signs
4. Don't text and drive
5. Show up ten minutes early for an appointment
6. Get in the longest checkout line at the grocery store
7. Turn your smartphone into a dumb phone
	- Greyscale mode
8. Get a flip phone, or ditch your cell phone all together
9. Parent your phone; put it to bed before you and make it sleep in
10. Keep your phone off until after your morning quiet time
11. Set times for email
12. Set a time and a time limit for social media (or just get off it)
13. Kill your TV
14. Single-task
	- There is no such things a multitasking, it is actually task-switching
15. Walk slower
16. Take a regular day alone for silence and solitude
17. Take up journaling
18. Experiment with mindfulness and meditation
	- The Greek once said, “The unexamined life is not worth living.”
	- Breath in the Holy Spirit and exhale everything that is not
		- Breathe in love, breathe out anger
		- Breathe in joy, breathe out sadness and pain
		- Breathe in peace, breathe out anxiety and uncertainty of tomorrow
		- Breathe in patience, breathe out the hurry of my life
	- Psalm 1: “Blessed is the one…who meditates on his law day and night.” In meditation of the Hebrew/Jesus variety, you don’t just empty your mind (of the noise, chaos, anxiety, etc.), but you fill your mind with Scripture, with truth, with the voice of the Holy Spirit
	- Meditation is filling the mind with God's word
	- We become what we consume [[../../Garbage In, Garbage Out|Garbage In, Garbage Out]] (Phil 4)
19. If you can take long vacations
20. Cook your own food. And eat in.

### Epilogue: A quiet life
- The end is to to come back to God and our true selves.
- The goal is practice, not perfection
- Every present is an opportunity to experience the eternal life, life to the full that Jesus promised
- Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life
