The below table shows the key mapping of the 8Bitdo Zero 2. I use this along with Karabiner to remap the controllers to more useful keys.

| Controller     | Keyboard |
| -------------- | -------- |
| A              | g        |
| B              | j        |
| X              | h        |
| Y              | i        |
| ArrowLeft      | e        |
| ArrowRight     | f        |
| ArrowUp        | c        |
| ArrowDown      | d        |
| Select         | n        |
| Start          | o        |
| Left Shoulder  | k        |
