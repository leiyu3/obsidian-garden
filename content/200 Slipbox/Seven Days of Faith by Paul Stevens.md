title: Seven Days of Faith
---

- How to live out faith in the day to day
- Danger of the "layperson spirituality" mentality 

## Part One: A Day at Work
### Faith: Doing God's Work
- Work by design is seemed to be meaningless, because we ultimately find our satisfaction in Jesus (Ecclesiastes)
- Working for God, "When did we ever clothed you Jesus?"
### Love: Becoming amateurs
- The word *amateur* used to mean someone who does something out of love
- 1 Corinthian 13, Work is nothing without love
- To know someone, you ask them what they love not what they 
- God is always working and so work is good
- God gave men 3 full time work: communion with Him, community building, and co-creation 
- Falling out of love with work is like falling out of love over a spouse. It takes effort
	- Many look for new spouse to look for fulfillment like when they look for new work for fulfillment
- Work prompted by love ([[../../1 Thess 1#3|1 Thess 1:3]])
- Workaholics only focuses on the "co-creation" part
	- They become a burden to other around them because they force their priority on others
### Hope:  Making Our Mark on Heaven
- There is no secular-sacred division. All work are to be done to God and for God.
- End time idleness (1 Thessalonians)
- Ready for the long haul, but expected Christ's return soon (Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgin)
- 1 Corinthians 15:58
- [[../../1 Cor 3#12|1 Cor 3:12-15]], it is logical that "Christian Work" done not for Christ will be burned and a "Boat" build for Christ will be preserved in the last day
- The work we do on Earth will have a mark on the New Heaven and New Earth, but they will be transfigured
> [!QUOTE] _Mere Christianity_ by C.S. Lewis
> If you read history you will find that the Christians who did most for the present world were just those who thought most of the next… It is since Christians have largely ceased to think of the other world that they have become so ineffective in this. Aim at Heaven and you will get earth ‘thrown in’: aim at earth and you will get neither (p. 134).” 

## Part Two: A Day with the Family
### Finding God at Home
- Family is where they have to take you in, where you somehow got in even when you don't deserve it
- Family it self is a spiritual discipline, practice of grace
- in the modern and western world "the family" is being attack
	- people are getting divorced more and more
	- less people are getting married
	- individualism is on the rise
	- more "in-law" arrangement than traditional marriages
	- less people wanting to have kids (with advancing contraceptives)
- The Family is the oldest institution we have. 
	- Adam and Eve was the first family even before the nation and the church
	- In OT time family extends to slaves, aliens, and more. Not like the nuclear family of today
	- In NT time, the family extends to the spiritual family, to which no believers is ever alone

### Raising Godly Parents
- honouring parents is not obeying parents
	- children should obey parents until they reach a certain age into adult hood, and especially if they are married
- Parenting as hospitality, as host and stewards. Not ultimate owners but that their children belongs to God
- Whether the child come to faith is ultimately up to God, and not the parent's work.

### Being Married for Good
- Being and not doing
- Christ wants a spouse and not a slave
- A covenant is binding
- The covenant is unconditional, but the blessing of the covenant is conditional
- Marriage is a monastery

## Part Three: A Day with the Other Sex
### Sacred Sexuality

### Contemplative Sexuality
- mystery of sexuality and the mystery of God
- Both sex are equal but different

### Prayerful Sexuality
- being filled with the Spirit and mutual submission
- Singleness as Spiritual Discipline, our desires tells us that we are not self-sufficient. Even in marriage we still don't find full satisfaction.
- Prayerful in mutual submission in marriage, and prayerful in our wants and needs in singleness.

## Part Four: A Day with Brothers and Sisters
### Friendship
- [[../../John 15#15|John 15:15]]
- Friendship or service to self?
	- **Friendship is not for anything**
	- Friendship in pure enjoyment of the person itself.
	- learning friendship from the trinity
- Intercessory prayer in the ministry of friendship
	- we get the mind of God through prayer
	- Praying with the Holy Spirit ([[../../Rom 8#26|Rom 8:26]])
	- the most direct path to others is indirectly through Christ
- Accountability
	- *One who is alone in his sin is utterly alone*

### Ministry
- mutual priesthood
- no divide between the layperson and the "pastor"
### Partnership

## Part Five: A Day Alone
### Being Hungry
- The average American is exposed to 1,200 advertisements a day
- Most people are shaped from the outside (work, achievements, relationships, possessions)
- Spiritual discipline comes from *desperation*
- In the modern world “Silence is violence”, they would be forced to come to themselves like the prodigal son in the far country
- Solitude is different from loneliness. Solitude is intentional to spend time with self and God.
- Thanks giving:
	- Contentment is not about your circumstances.
	- We have learned the *secrete* of being discontent in every circumstance. We have to learn to be content in all circumstances
	- The older brother of the prodigal son. While he was in the state of his father’s blessing, he did not think so.
- Confession
	- Gratitude and confession are like inhaling and exhaling
	- God can only bless real people
	- Go through the 10 commandment and reflect, how have I broken this commandment
	- Meditate over the fruit of the spirit and see how they have manifested in Christ’s life, and if they have manifested in you
	- Repentance from the prodigal son
		- “He came to his sense”, he began by “Father give me” to “Father make me”
		- He recognized his need, he planned, and he put it into action
- Meditation:
	- Meditate on the word of God
	- Muttering and spending time on it.

### Being Found
- Being alone to confront yourself
- Be real to be found by God
- Question to reflect on:
	- why am I so sensitive to criticism? Enter
	- Why am I so driven to fill in all the gaps in my datebook?
	- Why do I find it hard to give places and positions?
	- Why do I often put myself down in front of others?
	- Why am I so competitive?
	- Why is this so important for me to succeed?
	- Why am I unable to let go of the pain of others?
	-  why do I need people so desperately and I’m so afraid to be alone?
	- Why am I discontent?
	- Why do certain kinds of people get under my skin?
	- Why do I tend to burn out relationships?
	- Why am I so busy?
	- Why am I so unmotivated? 
- It is not those who are self-sufficient that are found, but those that knows weakness
- “True religion is knowing God and knowing ourselves” - John Calvin
### Being Real
- The Psalm at many time is David's journal entry to God
- The Psalms shows us that we are to show our full expression of feeling and emotion to God
- God blesses real people
- Don't let journaling become utilitarian
- Going through life in your journal and walking through various life events whether painful or good with Jesus.

## Part Seven: A Day with the Neighbour
### The Poor
- The rich can not be saved without the poor
- The rich are not owner of their wealth but steward of the poor
- [[../../Matt 25#34|Matt 25:34-46]]
- The only treasure we can take to the next life is the relationships we have made in this life through Jesus
### The Stranger
- *hospitality* in greek mean love for the strangers
- [[../../The Parable of the Good Samaritan|The Parable of the Good Samaritan]] teaches us to become neighbors
- replacing “stranger anger” with hospitality
- To make the “stranger” feel at home. “There is a beautiful person in there that wants to come out”
- To *enjoy* the person No one wants to become a “love an unlovable person” project
### The Outsider
- The book of [[../../Jonah|Jonah]] as prophetic comedy
	- a missionary that got saved through his mission
	- a missionary that tells other something that he hardly believe to a group of people that he doesn't like,  and was then himself converted
	- The outsiders (sailors) that showed more faith and humanity than Jonah

## Part Seven: A Day of Rest
### Leisure
- Leisure v.s. Sabbath
- Leisure as pseudo Sabbath

### Play
- In the first instance of "holy" being mentioned in the bible [[../../Gen 2#3|Gen 2:3]], God made "time" holy.
	- Men are usually preoccupied with making *Holy Spaces*
- Four dimension of Sabbath
	- Regular rest (weekly, yearly, seven yearly and 50th yearly)
	- Playfulness and wastefulness in God's creation
		- [[../../Job 38#25|Job 38:25-27]], *where no man is*
	- Tradition of festivity
	- affirmation of Godly pleasure (sex in [[../../Song of Solomon|Song of Solomon]])
		- sex as marital sabbath
- Play and work should be together
	- Play doesn't necessarily mean unproductive
	- When God creates He "play" in that the work was joyous, spontaneous, and completely free
- Exodus as eternal freedom, and Sabbath as internal freedom
-  Simply *being* than *doing*, leisure and Sabbath doesn't have to be **productive**

### Sabbath
- Worship as "playing heaven"
- One day of the week
- Every day of the week
	- Sabbath is resting from our working and entering into God's work
		- Picture of salvation of not relying on our work, but on God's work for salvation
	- Daily devotionals as "mini-sabbaths"
