## Hallowed be Your Name
[[../../Matt 6#9|Matt 6:9]] Pray then like this: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.  

Hallowed means holy. So we are praying for God's name to be holy for all people to see. [[../../God's Glory|God's Glory]]

Holy mean pure, perfect, flawless and set apart.



## Give Us Today Our Daily Bread
[[../../Matt 6#11|Matt 6:11]] Give us this day our daily bread,  

This means to ask God to provide for what is sufficient for us today. 

Just like [[mana|mana]]. God provided for the day's portion. And the Israelites have to trust God that He will do the same thing tomorrow.
