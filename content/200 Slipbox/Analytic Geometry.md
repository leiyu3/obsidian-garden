## Medians, Right Bisectors, and Altitudes

> [!NOTE] Median of a Triangle
> A line that goes from the vertex of a triangle to the mid point of the opposite side
> ![[../attachments/Analytic Geometry-20240308164656841.webp|center|200]]
> - mid point of the opposite side
> - find slope from mid point to vertex
> - find y-int

> [!NOTE] Perpendicular Bisector
> a line that passes through the midpoint of a line and is perpendicular to it
> ![[../attachments/Analytic Geometry-20240308164738789.webp|center|200]]
> - find midpoint of line
> - find slope of line
> - find slope of perpendicular line
> - use midpoint and slope of perpendicular line

> [!NOTE] Altitude
> A line that connect vertex to the opposite side, the altitude is perpendicular to the opposite side
> ![[../attachments/Analytic Geometry-20240308165118269.webp|center|200]]
> - find slope of opposite side
> - find perpendicular slope (altitude slope)
> - use altitude slope and point of vertex to find y-int of altitude
