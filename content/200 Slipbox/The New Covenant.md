> **31**"Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah,  **32**not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD.  **33**For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.  **34**And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more."

> $^{26}$ And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.  $^{27}$ And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.  


- Moses anticipated the New Covenant
	- one day the Lord will give Israel a "heart to understand" [[../../Deut 29#4|Deut 29:4]]
	- the Israel will fail to keep the Old Covenant [[../../Deut 29#22|Deut 29:22-28]]
	- the Lord will give a time of restoration [[../../Deut 30#1|Deut 30:1-5]]
	- [[../../Deut 3#6|Deut 3:6]] "circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants...."

-  Not like [[The Old Covenant |The Old Covenant ]]
	- There was nothing wrong with the Old Testament, it was that the people couldn't follow it [[../../Jer 31#32|Jer 31:32]]
	- God blesses and protects His people unconditionally
	- The sin problem has been dealt with once for all in the New Covenant by the sacrifice of Christ [[../../Heb 10#10|Heb 10:10]]
- The content of the New Covenant [[../../Jer 31#33|Jer 31:33-34]] and [[../../Ezek 36#26|Ezek 36:26-27]] 
	- God will put his law within His people
		- The law will be written on their heart (instead of on stone tablets)
	- He will be their God, and they will be His people
		- Similar to the Old Covenant but with no condition?
	- All shall know the Lord
		- What does this actually mean?
	- God will forgive their iniquity, and remember their sin no more
		- This was achieved by Christ's life, death, and resurrection
	- Indwelling of the Holy Spirit
- The New Covenant was made effective by the death of Jesus [[../../Luke 22#20|Luke 22:20]]
- [[../../2 Cor 3|2 Cor 3]], Paul also talks about the New Covenant
	- #question The New Covenant is permanent? [[../../2 Cor 3#11|2 Cor 3:11]]


- Sign of the New Covenant
	- Baptism
- Seal of the New Covenant
	- Holy Spirit
## Compared to the Old
- Jesus is our High Priest, and through Him we can draw near to God with confidence [[../../Heb 10#19|Heb 10:19-22]]
- The New Covenant came an internal change of heart, as oppose to external regulations
- The Old Covenant stress teaching the Law to each other [[../../Deut 6#6|Deut 6:6-9]], but in the New Covenant everyone will know the Lord [[../../Jer 31#34|Jer 31:34]]
