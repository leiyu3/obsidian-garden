Since the start of 2024, I've had the privilege of working as an RPA Developer at a Fortune 500 company, and I'd like to share my experience and some lessons I've learned.
#### What is RPA and what does a RPA Developer do?
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) involves automating computer-based tasks, such as data entry and form filling and submission. RPA typically uses simple conditional statements (e.g., if True, then do A; else, do B) and can be enhanced with Machine Learning techniques like computer vision. An RPA Developer's responsibilities include defining processes to automate, designing solutions, testing these solutions, and maintaining and monitoring them post-deployment.
#### Why Choose to be an RPA Developer?
With a background in Mechatronic Engineering and computer science, I was drawn to RPA because it combines problem-solving with automation to enhance efficiency and people's lives. This aligns well with my interests in software development, making RPA a natural fit given my skill set.
#### Lessons Learned
One lesson I learned is that having good colleagues and workplace culture makes a big difference in the enjoyment of your work. Initially, I focused on the tasks and the role, overlooking the significance of the people that I will be working with. Now, I realized that work environment can have a significant impact on job satisfaction. 

Another lesson I learned was that I enjoy problem solving. At first I was looking for engineering or software positions, working in RPA made me realized that what I really enjoy is problem solving. 

In conclusion, my experience has taught me to be open to opportunities. Even if a role may not be exactly what you were looking for, it might lead you to learn something new about yourself. Also, good colleagues can make a world of difference in you work place. Therefore, strive to be a good colleague yourself!
