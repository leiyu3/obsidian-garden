I have the privilege of working as a RPA Developer at a Fortune 500 company since the start of this year and I would like to share my experience so far, and some lesson I learned.
#### What is RPA and what does a RPA Developer do?
Robotic Process Automation is concerned with automation of tasks that are done on a computer, one example of this would be data entry and filling and submitting of forms. The processes that RPA deals with are generally done with simple conditional statements (if True then do A, else do B). Its capabilities can also be extended with Machine Learning, such computer vision. A RPA Developer's responsibility would usually include **defining** of processes to automate, **designing** a solution, testing the **solution** and then **maintaining and monitoring** the solution after deployment. These are usually done using a software that is specifically built for designing and testing RPA processes. The two programs used by corporations are Blue Prism and UiPath.
#### Why RPA Developer?
I have a Mechatronic Engineering Degree and a computer science background. When I found out that RPA involves problem solving, and automation of the boring stuff to make people's life better. I thought why don't I try it out! Since problem solving and automation are also two of the reasons why I want to learn software development, and I believe I have the background and skill sets to be able to do a good job at it.
#### Lessons Learned
One thing I learned from this opportunity is that your co-workers makes a big difference in the enjoyment of your work. Having good colleagues and good work culture makes the your work. When I was first looking for a job, I was more focused on what I will be doing. I wasn't thinking about what kind of people I will be working with. But now I realized that it can be just as important. 

Another thing I learned was that I enjoy problem solving. At first I was looking for engineering or software positions. But through this experience I realized that what I really enjoy is problem solving. 

So some take aways from my experience is to be open to opportunities. It may not be exactly what you were looking for but you might find surprises and learn something new about yourself. Also, good colleagues can make a world of difference in you work place. So strive to be a good colleague yourself!
