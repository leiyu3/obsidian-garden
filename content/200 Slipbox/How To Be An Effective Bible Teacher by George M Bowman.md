title: How To Be An Effective Bible Teacher
---

## Review
Gives good instruction on the pitfalls of bible teaching, and gives instruction on the characteristic of a good bible teacher. I like the emphasis on practical bible knowledge and the emphasis on being able to help and counsel people using those bible knowledge.

Gives more on how to prepare and lead a bible study/lesson. 

## Note
- As a bible teacher your responsibility is to ... in the order of their importance
	1. The Word of God
	2. The Church
	3. Students

- A general outline of a lesson would be:
	- Question
	- Discussion
		- Ensure that opinions are tested with the Word of God
	- Declaration
		- Ending with God's truth to get rid of any confusion from Discussion and to help God's truth linger for the rest of the day

### Picking Bible Teachers
- Familiarity with the Word of God
	- Being able to use it practically and apply it
- **Mature** understanding of the problem of life
	- Learn and live!
	- Learning from the experience of others -> Empathy
	- Declaring ignorance!
	- Emotional maturity, a group can rise no higher than its leader
- **Courage** to use the Word of God as the last court of Appeal
	- The Bible also speaks on different area of life, in law, economics, physical health, mental health and etc..

- Don't put someone in a leadership position without careful examination of their character. Use the characteristics described in 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus.
- Don't put someone in a leadership position just because you "don't want to lose him"
- Church should have a job description as well as characteristics they are looking for, for a leadership position. Instead of "we gotta fill this position at all cost, if it breaths, we hire'em"
- Look out for prideful leaders who are only seeking the title of office but not the dedication of service
- Beware of **nepotism** when selecting candidates

- A-B-C: **Ability** to do the job, **Behavior** pattern in his life which set a good example for others, and **Creed** that motivates to unselfish service to the Lord
- What you believe (not what you think you believe) is what you really are
- Faith have 4 components: Knowledge, believe, conviction, commitment (2 Tim 1:12)
- Solid knowledge on the Doctrine of God, of His sovereignty 
- Never make the position of bible teaching easy to get
- Live up to the calling that God has called you to.
	1) Think Right 
		- Feeding your new nature with the Word of God
	2) Act Right 
		- Kill sin through love of God and love of other and replacing sin with their moral opposites
	3) Dress Right (Colossians)
		-  compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience, forgiveness, and love
		- Forgiveness is dependent on justice, the repentence or the ignorance of the individual

### Lesson Planning
- Have a one sentence thesis (Lesson Objective) before planning your outline for your lesson
- Only read what other have written about the passage or issue only after you have done the outline and one sentence thesis.
	- This is to minimize notes needed when you are teaching
- You will spend a lot of time preparing. You're struggle as a good bible teacher shouldn't be finding things to say, but finding the time to say it.
- Generate questions from the outline <- objectives
	- Think of question that the students will have, make sure that you can answer exhaustively all the questions that could arrive through the passage
- Search for answer to those questions
- Once you have all your materials, organize them into an outline with subordinate points
- Write you intro and conclusion with the Lesson Objective in mind
- Then look through your major and subordinate points and see if they support your Lesson Objective
- Finally, find illustrations or anecdotes to support your Lesson objective
- Don't read your lessons, your outline should be just enough to jog your memory

### Presentation
- Don't change your voice from your normal conversational voice
- Don't sound like your know greek or Hebrew, quote an authoritative source
- Don't shout
- Keep eye contact
- Don't stare at your notes
- Always think critically when using resources and of your own ideas as well
- Don't use overly casual register that can make it seem like you are making fun of God's word. The audience should get a sense of deep respect for the holiness and authority of God from you.
