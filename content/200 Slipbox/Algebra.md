This is where math starts using letters.

## The 2 Rules of Algebra
1. What you do to one side you do to the other
2. Isolate for what you are solving

- `n` unknowns require `n` equations to solve.

When the question asks:
- Solve for $x$ -> you want to isolate for $x$
	- You do this by applying `Rule 1`

## What is a Variable?
- a place holder for a number
- the number can change

## Opposite Operations
| + | - |
| ---- | ---- |
| $\times$ | $\div$ |
| $x^y$ | $\sqrt[y]{x}$ |

## Order of Operation for Algebra
- When solving for a variable you follow the reverse order for BEDMAS
	- Addition and subtraction first
	- then division and multiplication
	- then brackets and exponents
