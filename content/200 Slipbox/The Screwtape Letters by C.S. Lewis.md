## Chapter 20
- Satan's attack have an end?
- Satan's best weapon is the "belief of ignorant humans"
    - "that there is no hope of getting rid of us except by yielding"

Screwtape says that it is now best to direct the attack on marrying the wrong women.
- using the culture to guide people away from useful characteristics in a partner
    - “The aim is to guide each sex away from those members of the other with whom spiritually helpful, happy, and fertile marriages are most likely.”
- emphasizing the secondary characteristics (beard)
- These "secondary" characteristics changes through time
- fake beauty standard (unachievable)

Two direction the devil can direct our desires
1. terrestrial
    - “readily mixed with charity, readily obedient to marriage, coloured all through with that golden light of reverence and naturalness which we detest;”
2. Infernal Venus
    - “a type best used to draw him away from marriage altogether but which, even within marriage, he would tend to treat as a slave, an idol, or an accomplice.”
    - prostitue or mistress

## Chapter 21

- Do we own time?
    - Are we foolishly believing that time is our own?
- time as birthright?
- Time is a gift
- “The man can neither make, nor retain, one moment of time; it all comes to him by pure gift;”
- “He would be greatly relieved if that one day involved nothing harder than listening to the conversation of a foolish woman; and he would be relieved almost to the pitch of disappointment if for one half-hour in that day the Enemy said “Now you may go and amuse yourself”. Now if he thinks about his assumption for a moment, even he is bound to realise that he is actually in this situation every day.”
    - We are actually quite privilege.
    - We are given 24 hour everyday to serve God. And we still have so much time to amuse/entertain ourself.
- Satan often don't want us to think about anything. Reason is the devil's enemy. The devil wants to hide and put things in darkness.
- Ownership is a funny idea. Do we truly own anything? Or are we just stewards?
- Chasity/Lust comes from the idea that men "own" their bodies. Do we really own our bodies?
    - “It is as if a royal child whom his father has placed, for love’s sake, in titular command of some great province, under the real rule of wise counsellors, should come to fancy he really owns the cities, the forests, and the corn, in the same way as he owns the bricks on the nursery floor.”
- Satan produce this "sense of ownership" by pride and confusion
    - "My ___" 
- What is ownership?

## Chapter 22
Christian is in love!

The girl as Screwtape/Wormwood describes her.
“Not only a Christian but such a Christian—a vile, sneaking, simpering, demure, monosyllabic, mouse-like, watery, insignificant, virginal, bread-and-butter miss.”

- vile
    - morally bad
- simpering
    - pleased?
- demure
    - reserved, modest, shy

## Chapter 23
Christian has been doing well because of his love interest.

Satan has another weapon.
- A spoiled saint, a Pharisee, an inquisitor, or a magician.

Religion and politic
- Seeking to make Christ "relevant"
- Christianity as a mean to social justice. Which is very shaky ground to be on. Making the christian use Christianity for his own will.

Satan seeks to distract men and make them forget about God's words. The prophets seek to remind men about the word of God.

Biography of Jesus vs. The resurrection and redemption of sinners.
- The resurrection and redemption saved men.
- The gospel then seek to edify those saved men.

Very interesting...
The resurrection and redemption is also within the gospel. But you do need to know the context.

Beware of using faith as a means to an end.

## Chapter 24
Slumtrimpet
- a small chink in the love interest's armour
    - prejudice against non-believers (looking down on them)
    - in another word Spiritual Pride
- The young men is in a position to quickly imitate his surroundings.
    - making him imitate this defect of his mistress. 
    - and exaggerate it ("It is always the novice who exaggerates")

The young man wants to fit in.
- This leaves him vulnerable

The more subtle your Spiritual Pride is the more dangerous

Habits and pitfalls.

Beware of attitude of apathy with worship

## Chapter 25

"merely" Christian -> a reference to Mere Christianity?

Mixing Christianity and something...
- Synchronism
- I think I'm susceptible to Christianity and Minimalism...

The horror of the Same Old Thing
- love of change with a love of permanence
- Satan takes good things and exaggerate it to turn it into a bad thing
    - natural pleasantness of change -> demand for absolute novelty
        - the exagerrated demand/desire causes men to use the forbidden means to satisfied those desires
    - it diminishes pleasure while increasing desire

Trends distracts men from the real problem at hand. Their sin.

God loves platitudes:
- is it right? is it just? is it true?

Satan wants us to ask these questions instead?
- does this keep up with the time?
- is it progressive or reactionary?

Satan has changed the "unchanged" to an emotional word "stagnant".
