## The Problem of Evil

 ![[../attachments/Why Is There Evil by R.C. Sproul.pdf|Why Is There Evil by R.C. Sproul.pdf]]

1. How can a good and all powerful God create creation or creature with the possibility of evil?
2. How can a good God allow all the suffering we find existing in life?

- *theodicy*, to justify God

- First approach: evil is an illusion, there is no true evil
- Second approach: evil is necessary to experience good
	- fail to deal with God's negative judgement toward human sin
- Gottfried Leibniz
	- 3 Level of Evil: Moral, Physical, and Metaphysical
	- Moral evil involves moral choices by moral agents
	- Physical evil involved natural disasters
	- Metaphysical evil involves imperfection in the "being", being finite
	- Moral evil flows out of physical evil, physical evil flows out of metaphysical evil
		- "I sin because I am finite"
	- God can't create human without sin, because to create human without sin would be to create him metaphysically perfect, which means to create another "god", but that "god" couldn't be metaphysically perfect because he wouldn't be like God (still dependant on the original God for his being)
	- Fallacy of Equivocation
		- Metaphysical evil not just justify exisitence of evil for God, but also justifies man's evil
		- Man could not have be made free of sin in heaven
		- Adam never fell, he was created in sin. He was physically & metaphysically evil even before eating the apple
- Men have been given free will, that comes with the ability to choose to do good and evil
	- The question remains "Why did Adam and Eve choose evil?"
	- If the Devil made them do it, then would that excuse them from sin?


- What was the state Adam and Eve in morally? What was their moral inclination? Evil, Good, Neutral?
	- if evil then they were fallen even before the fruit and sin is result of God's creation
	- if good, then why did they disobey God?
	- if neutral, then it wouldn't be considered a moral choice. no inclination; they would be in paralysis

- Do we sin when we were tempted?
	- Desire for a good, is not a sin
		- desire to fill your hunger is not a sin
	- Desire for intrinsically bad, is a sin
		- Desiring to disobey God, would be a sin to
- What does it mean to be **free**?
