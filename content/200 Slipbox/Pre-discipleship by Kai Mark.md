## Review
The book is good for most part, there are some part of the book which I didn't really connect with and felt was too dense and went over my head. He quotes a lot of ideas that others have thought of to help support his point of the importance of Prediscipleship and that it is the right way that we should do evangelism. I think it is fair for him to write in that way. But I would say maybe 30% of the book as a lot of things that I just felt not necessary. Especially when he started to quote a bunch of people I don't know about concepts and ideas that I don't get.

The main idea of the book though I really believe in. If you are struggling with how to share the gospel or how should you nudge your unbelieving friends toward Christ. This book gives a fresh perspective, with resource of materials to go through on how to do that.

## Summary

Problem with Evangelism in the modern age, the evangelistic campaign that we run are high effort but have small results. The pattern of getting people to make an decision after hearing the gospel is not the right way that we should be doing evangelism. Even when people do make a decision for Christ, many times they don't end up becoming disciple of Jesus, and often actually leaves the church after a while.

Kai Mark makes the case for pre-discipleship as a key element of one's conversion. And uses various factors to show that.

Pre-discipleship have the idea of teaching someone what it means to be a follower of Jesus. When someone have all the information they need, they can count the cost and make a commitment to follow Jesus. 

When someone hear the Gospel there can be 3 responses:
1. They receive the message, believes and follow Jesus
2. They Reject the message
3. They can't make a decision because they don't have enough data to make a decision
	- This is where most people are -> the book suggest 95% of people are here

The bible too make the case:
- a king would only go to battle if he knows that his army can win
- a builder would count the cost, to see if he has the resources and time to be able to complete something

Evangelistic campaigns has a ROI rate of 1000 to 1 (disciple).

Many conversion in the bible are of people who have a strong back ground of the Law of Moses and OT. They already have a strong foundation, and that is why they are able to quickly make a decision after following Jesus. Many Jews have the Torah memorized.

And the Greeks who converted. Those that are interested were already worshipper of God and have been learning about Him.

Three Types of Conversion Modes
1. Encounter (Dramatic)
	- Paul's conversion would go in here
2. Unconscious
	- Those who grew up in the church
3. Conscious
	- Those who had to learn about Christ and slowly become convinced that Jesus is the only way, they're sin needs forgiving

Pre-disicpleship, is the process of teaching someone all that they need to know what it means to follow Jesus.
- For this Kai Mark suggest, that the material to be short 5-7 weeks so that it is easier for one to make the commitment
- So what are the things that one needs to know? Kai Mark wrote a book called *Seven Discoveries* that covers what he deems to be necessary for one to make an educated commitment to Christ.
