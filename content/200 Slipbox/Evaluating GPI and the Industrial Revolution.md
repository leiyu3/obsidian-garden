## Introduction
The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is a metric that better measures welfare and sustainability of a country than the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It does this by defining and measuring “consumption” in a way that better approximate the well being of a country, as wells as incorporating measurements of changes in the value of capital stocks [^Hamilton1999]. GPI places values on whether or not nonrenewable resources are being used up, the average time use of the population, and advancement in technology [^Hamilton1999]. The Industrial Revolution of the 1780s in England has a massive impact on GPI. It affected the environment negatively through pollution and land system changes. And affected the society positively through better time use, advancement in technologies, better job market and better economic opportunities. 

## Effect of the Industrial Revolution on the Environment 
The Industrial Revolution brought forth changes to land systems. Lands that were previously rural has been changed into industrial landscapes. Mining and the burning of coals sent pollutants into the atmosphere, on a scale not seen before by human beings. Smokestacks became the symbol of the Industrial Revolution. It is safe to say that the Industrial Revolution has had a negative effect on the environment. Rural areas in England experienced rapid changes to their landscape during the Industrial Revolution, as factories were being built in view of new prosperity. The effect of this change of landscape can best be seen in Manchester, England. Below are two pictures of the city of Manchester. On the left is Manchester in the 1750s before the Industrial Revolution and on the right is the same location but in the 1850s, about a century after the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.

A big change can be seen in the landscape. The old skyline has been replaced by smokestacks. This dramatic change of land system use has negatively impacted the environment. As green spaces are being destroyed to build more factories, chemical waste and air pollution are released into the environment. This increases the rate of environmental degradation.

The burning and mining of coal not only releases carbon dioxide into the air but also sulphur dioxide. This is the main culprit for acidic rain, which was discovered during the time of the Industrial Revolution by a Scottish chemist named Robert Angus Smith. This discovery was made in Manchester, a major centre of manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution in England [^RinkeshKukreja2017]. The Industrial Revolution increased the intensity and frequency of acidic rain. 

Acidic rain negatively impacts the wellbeing of England. It alters the pH of lakes and ponds which makes them hostile to fish and aquatic vegetations to survive, greatly decreasing the fish population. Acidic rain can also negatively affect the longevity of infrastructures. As it catalyzes the weathering of materials, both natural and man-made. Because of this, the cost of maintaining buildings and infrastructure increases and built capital decreases [^RinkeshKukreja2017].

## Effect of the Industrial Revolution on Society
The Industrial Revolution has had various effects on society, consisting of both positive and negative influences. The Industrial Revolution lead to many technological advancements that made life easier. It changed people’s livelihoods and financial prospects. The population shifted from an agrarian economy to one dominated by machines and industry [^EncyclopediaBritannica2017].

The growth of technology helps people to do work more effectively. The steam engine is a clear example of this. First developed to mine coal it replaced horses in agriculture in the shape of a tractor, being able to do more work than a horse while also being cheaper to maintain. Previously, a part of the farmland had to be used to grow the feeds that the horses need. With the tractor, the farmer only has to buy the gasoline to fuel it [^LivingHistoryFarm2017]. Thus, the tractor is preferred over horses. It allows the farmer to have more land to grow food. This increases the amount of food that can be outputted while using the same amount of land. With more crops that can be sold for cash, the farmer can get his money back from the cost of buying gasoline. In return, it allows more people to be fed.

The advancement of technology is a double edged-sword. The multitudes of factories being built during the Industrial Revolution made many jobs available. For example, in looking at textile factories. The effectiveness of machines such as the Spinning Jenny and the Water Frame made work easier. The machines were simple to operate, making skilled workers obsolete in certain manufacturing fields. It also decreased the number of people needed to do the same amount of work. Technology decreased the skill needed to qualify for a job, but at the same time decreased the number of jobs available [^IntriguingHistory2017]. Many employers also took advantage of the fact that factory jobs are easier. They preferred to use child labour as part of their workforce. This is because children can be paid less than adults. And were convenient to replace as there were many in the orphanages. Children were also less likely to protest than adults [^Trueman2015]. 

The Industrial Revolution, however, did increase the welfare of the majority. Roads, canals and railroads were being built across Britain, drastically decreasing the toils of travelling long distances. The Industrial Revolution also decreased the cost of producing and shipping goods. Time to commute shortens and people began to have more leisure time. Factory work was also much easier than agricultural work. Fewer People had to do hard manual labour and most factory works were done indoors. The rise in popularity of the Birmingham Toys is just one of the indicators that people are now more well off. As people are becoming less and less worried about how to bring food to the table, there is more time left for play.

## Measuring Welfare and Sustainability of from the effects of Industrial Revolution
The changes brought into the environment from the Industrial Revolution are unsustainable if measured through GPI. The Industrial Revolution was the beginning of mass emission of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, increasing the chance of acidic rain [^RinkeshKukreja2017] and begins the process of global climate change [^AmericanChemicalSociety2007]. It is also the beginning of mass mining and consumption of nonrenewable resources, predominantly, coal and iron. The mining of these materials causes environmental damages. For example, the mining process usually releases toxic chemicals and changes the natural landscapes around the mine. The Industrial Revolution jeopardizes biodiversity and land systems. It would be unsustainable in the view of GPI because it decreases the natural capital. The unsustainability of the Industrial Revolution practices can be seen today. Global climate change is now a staggering problem and biodiversity are declining. This credits the GPI’s ability to give a proper judgement of what is sustainable and what is not. 

GPI would increase in view of the changes brought socially through the Industrial Revolution. The time for commute has gone down, increasing time available for people to do more meaningful work. The introduction of new machines that made work easier too can be valued as an increase. Even though machines decrease the amount of jobs available, it also decreased the job requirements. It also increased the amount of goods that can be produced, therefore increasing welfare by increasing economic prosperity. For example, the tractor increased the amount of food that can be produced, thus, fewer and fewer people are worried about how to gain the foods that they need to survive in a post-industrial world. We can see the effect of the Industrial Revolution by comparing it to other parts of the world that did not go through the Industrial Revolution. In Hans Rosling’s Ted Talk on Religion and Babies, Rosling mentions how countries with higher incomes will have fewer babies [^HansRosling2012]. This is due to the fact that well-off countries have lower infant mortality rates. Thus, countries that have not experience an Industrial Revolution have a lower living standard compared to countries that have. Overall, by looking at the trends we can see that the Industrial Revolution increased the living standard in England. GPI served as a good indicator of the increase of social welfare.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, GPI has served as a good indicator of how events and actions affect the sustainability and welfare of a society. GPI viewed the use of unreliable resources and burning of fossil fuels to be unsustainable. This can be seen today as the Industrial Revolution decreased biodiversity and the balance in the biosphere today. GPI view that less time spent on commuting increases living standard. More jobs mean that more people can do meaningful work. Technological advancements decreased the amount of hard manual labour jobs. Overall, GPI is a good system of measurement to represent welfare and sustainability in a country.
