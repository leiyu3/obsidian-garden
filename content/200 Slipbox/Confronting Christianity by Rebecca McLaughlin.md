## Aren't We Better Off Without Religion?

- New Atheism:
	- Sam Harris - The End of Faith, Letter to a Christian Nation
	- Richard Dawkin - The God Dilusion
	- Christopher Hitchen - God is Not Great

Benefits of Religion
- Relationship > Fame and wealth
- It is more blessed to give than to receive
	- religious people are more likely to give
- Money disappoints
	- Any wealth beyond providing for the basic needs, have much less effect on happiness
- We really can be happy in all circumstances (Phil 4:12-13)
- Gratitude is good for us
	- The Christian truly do have something to be thankful for at all time. Salvation, a gift from God
- Self-control and perseverance helps us drive
	- Jesus describes the Christian life as hard Matt 7;14
	- Hebrew 12:1-3, the Christian life a marathon
- Forgiveness is foundational
	- study have shown that Forgiveness not based on the action of the offender improves mental and physical health benefits

- The Happiness Hypothesis, do you want to be Bob or Marry?

Religion certainly doesn't poison everything. In fact it has many psychological and health benefits, that aligns now with modern psychology. It doesn't proof that Christianity is true, but it certainly doesn't dismiss it as false and that we should throw it away.

## Doesn't Christianity Crush Diversity?

- Is literacy western? Literacy did not start in the west, the most literate people today are not in the west, it offensive to suggest that majority of the world is literate because of appropriation 
- The Parable of the Good Samaritan, sets a Samaritan (a hated ethnic group by the Jews) as a positive moral example
- Jesus talked with a Samaritan Woman, what's more a morally compromised samaritan woman
- Col 3:11
- At the Pentacost, the Apostle spoke in different languages
- Gal 3:28
- Christianity was in Ethiopia way before entering the west
- Saint Augustine was from North Africa (Algeria)
- Christianity came from middle east, Jesus was a Jew
- Jesus followers were first called 'Christians' in Antioch, which is modern day Turkey, where Christians are highly persecuted today
- Iraq had a Christian root before Islam, and declined significantly around the time ISIS came along
- There is a growing Christian population in Iran
- India
	- Has Christian roots (Thomas?), or even in the 3rd or 4th century way before Britain colonization
	- Hinduism's caste system, highly devalues those of the *untouchables* which is probably why many of Indian Christians are from the *untouchable* caste. When another belief system elevates your values, it becomes a lot more attractive
- Diversity helps us to understand the cultural context of the bible (Middle Eastern)
	- Rebecca, (good wife, enchanted beauty, and cow (cows are revered in Nepal))
- China is becoming increasingly a Christian nation (in terms of growing Christians)
- women of color around the globe are more likely to be Christian
- South Korea exports the most missionaries
> [!QUOTE] [[../../Rev 7#9|Rev 7:9]] 
 $^{9}$ After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands,  

Christianity is perhaps the most diverse, most multiethnic, and most multicultural movement of all time.

## How Can You Say There is One Religion?
- Is it right to persuade someone to one particular religion?
- Is the parable of the Elephant in the room right about religion?
	- The parable only works because the narrator is not blind (how do you know it is actually the same elephant?)
### The problem of respect
- By saying all religion is the same is disrespecting all religion
- Agree to disagree, respect the people but not their belief
- The act of persuasion is an act of respect. We are treating people as thinking agents that they can make their own decision and that they are not just product of their environment
	- We treat people's belief seriously when we disagree with them
- Debates is important, it keeps us from echo chambers.
- The modern west thinks that tolerance is we are okay with the color of your skin as long as *you think the same as us*

### The Problem of Truth
- The good thing about truth is that it is true whether or not you believe

### The Problem of History
- Historical facts are objective truth as well
- Did Jesus died and rose again (Christian)? Or he did not die and was taken up to heaven (Islam)? Or he died and stayed dead (Atheists)
	- These are mutually exclusive truths and only one is right

### The Problem of Conversion
- There are people who convert to other religions or even to atheism. Part of the reason is that they find the other religion or belief to be true.
- It would not be respectful to say that all religion is the same or true, given people decision of conversion

### The Problem of Ethics
- Different religion and culture have different beliefs about ethical issues, what do we do when these issues clash? These can't all be true.
- The western secular world wants diversity of religion as long as you agree on the role of women and man being equal, the legitimacy of same sex marriage, and the freedom of your teen to explore sex freely. Is this really upholding their beliefs as equally true?

### The Problem of Monotheism
- though out history people have been living along side other with other beliefs. They do this with a compromise of polytheism. You have your local god, we have our local god.
- But Judaism, Christianity, and Islam claim to have only one God, the true God who made the heaven and the earth. Both exclusive and universal.
	- this contradicts all the other Polytheistic religions

### The Problem of Jesus
> [!QUOTE] [[../../John 14#6|John 14:6]] 
> $^{6}$ Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.  

> [!QUOTE] [[../../John 11#25|John 11:25-26]] 
> $^{25}$ Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live,  $^{26}$ and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?"  
- [[../../Matt 20#18|Matt 20:18-20]], all authority has been given to Jesus
- Jesus' claim to be God
	- which excludes Judaism, and Islam
	- [[../../Mark 2|Mark 2]]
- Jesus' claim of exclusivity

## Doesn't Religion Hinder Morality?
- problem of specificity
	- "Religion" covers a lot of different things
	- It would be like saying Philosophy hinders morality, when we are looking at Stalin, the Marxists, or Socialism, or Libertarianism
- Problem of Statistic
	- though many wrong are done in the context of religion
	- does not fit with the data that many and much more goods are done in correlation to religious practices
- Problem of Assuming there is Objective Morality
	- Without God where do you draw the line of what is moral and what is not?

- Without religion, where does your moral come from?
	- Universal Human Right Declaration
		- largely influenced by Judeo-Christianity
		- Not accepted by all (Saudi Arabia, North Korea, China)
- For most of history, man were valued higher than women, children
	- Plato and Aristotle supported direct eugenics
		- "Let there be a law that no deformed infants child shall live" The Politics, 192, Plato the Republic
	- Then came Jesus and Christians who claim that human are made in the image of God, there is no men or women, slave or free, Jew or Gentile
- Christianity greatly advocated for children
	- In the Roman Empire children were property
	- But when Christianity become a state religion, infantcide were outlawed, and later welfare were put in place so that poor family didn't have to sell their children

- can the world decide on a moral system based on secular belief?
	- Problem 1: most of the world are religious, and if everyone had a vote the majority would be Christian
	- Problem 2: Problem Two
		- *The Atheist's Guide to Morality* by Alex Rosenberg (p. 2-3)
		- Atheism, have no ground for any moral or ethical beliefs
			- "anything goes", there is no free will, we are only chemicals
	- What about evolutionary altruism?
		- Martin Nohawk: 1)Direct reciprocity 2)Indirect reciprocity 3) spatial selection 4) multilevel selection 5) kin selection
			- If this is true then fascism would be the ultimate virtuous ideology 
	- In atheism, the world view doesn't fit. Human are just atoms with no moral agents, but human are equal and also valuable
	- Christianity gives ground for the value and equality of man kind, while also give reason for self sacrificing love to others and God

## Doesn't Religion Cause Violence?
### "I Couldn't Be a Christian because of the Crusades"
- Jesus spoke of  turning the other cheek, loving your enemies, and He died praying for those who nailed Him to the cross. Matt 5:39, Luke 22:50-51, Matt. 5:44, Luke 23:34
- The Crusade was greatly misunderstood. It was a counter attack to the Muslims who attacked the Christian nations first (Egypt, Syria, Palestine) after the death of Muhammed
	- This however does not excuse the ethics (indescriminatory slaughter) used to retake back the land (Jerusalem)
- New Testament have a unified message of nonviolence taught by Jesus. Though there are times to bear arms to defend against the poor and powerless, but the ethics used were not justifiable
### What About Buddhism?
- Buddhism too also have blood on its hands
	- Rohingya Conflict
		- Rohingya muslims persecuted by the Myanmar government and nationalist Buddhist
	- Japan's persecution of Christians under Shintoism and Buddhism (*Silence* 2016 film)
	- Sri Lanka Wars, fueled by Nationalist Buddhists
- The point is that all major religions have blood on their hands

### Communist Dream, Communist Nightmare
- The early Christian saw what Jesus preached. To care for the poor and so the early church sold land to provide for the poor, the first hospital was opened by Christians, and they also started many well fare programs
- Karl Marx sees religion as *oppium of the masses*, he wants communism to be the key to 
	- He said that the New Testament has failed to bring its promise
- provide *utopia*. But under communism, 61 million killed under former Soviet Union, 35 mil killed under Republic of China, and other smaller communist states (North Korea, Vietnam, ...)
	- Under non-religious beliefs systems things gets worse

### Hitler's Religion
- Before WW2 Germany was a majority Christian state what happened?
- Hitler used religion for his own end. And the religion he used was not Christianity 
- Jesus was rebranded a Aryan (not jew)
- Nazi Bible removed the Old Testament, and removed any mention of Jesus' jewishness, Jesus' prioritization of reaching out to the Israelites, any fulfillment of the Hebrew bible from the New Testament
- They replaced Jesus' compassion for the poor in the sermon of the mount and made it militaristic
- They replaced Jesus with Hitler (!?)
- Children were taught to worship Hitler (Edited version of the Lord's Prayer)
- There are pastors who bought the lie
- There are those that fought back but were persecuted, sent to concentration camps etc...
	- Dietrich Bonhoeffer
	- Hans and Sophie Scholl

### Hitler's Philosopher
- Friedrich Nietzsche highly influenced Hitler
- "When one gives up the Christian faith, **one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet**"
- 

### Hitler's Science
- Hitler also used science to persuade, survival of the fittest
	- On the race that is stronger and better (Aryan) should continue, the weaker should not

### Reckoning with Hitler
- Hitler's example show us that we should we weary when people suggest that science can bring us a world better than religion, as many of the scientist agreed with Hitler on the hierarchy of certain races
- If we blame the Holocaust on religion, we also need to put the blame on contemporary science since Hitler used both

### What About Democracy?
- Democracy has Christian roots, equality of humans, servant leadership. Spread of mass education, mass printing, volunteer organizations, freedom of religion

### The Deeper Problem
- Not all Christians who claims to be Christian are authentically Christian. Jesus warns of those on the last day who would not be allowed into heaven but have called on His name. 
- The bible tells us to expect moral failures from Christians. Christian are still sinners and they grow to learn of their sin more and more. 

> [!QUOTE] [[../../1 John 1#8|1 John 1:8]] 
> $^{8}$ If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.  

- Certain sin might not give an advantage, so we are not tempted by it. But if it doesn't give certain advantage, pray by the grace of God that we will not succumb to its temptations.

### The Central Violence of the Christian Faith
- The death of Christ humiliate violence, as the most power man in the world died the most dishonourable death
- But Christ's resurrection shows that evil will not ultimately triumph.

## How Can You Take the Bible Literally?
- People use metaphors
- The bible have metaphors too
	- Some time the text have both literal and metaphor meanings (Physical healing as spiritual healing)
- Pay attention to genre and literature style to distinguish what is literal and what is metaphorical (Parable and Psalms)
- Paradoxes are not contradictions. Jesus often taught with paradoxes as well.
	- Jesus is both good Shepard and the Lamb of God, the alpha and the omega
	- Discribes a man beyond our understanding
	- Paradoxes only in words, but given more explanation they are not contradictions
- "The day you eat of it you would surly die": 3 possibility
	1. Talking about spiritual death but not physical death
	2. Physical death, but since a day is as 1000 year and 1000 year is as 1 day to the Lord, the death is not immediate
	3. Day and die is literal, but God lied or changed His mind

- The author of the Gospel orders events to make a theological point, chronology is not their focus
- "And then... and then... and then...", doens't necessarily mean the events happen right next to each other. Similar to how we say "one minute he says this, the next miniute he says this"
	- In films, the directory plays around with time (flash backs, etc.) to tell a story
- The gospel of mark were written when most eye witnesses were still alive, and the other writing were written when eye witness were becoming scarce. So it is written before it would be lost
	- The frequency of name of "Mary", "Simon" etc.. because they were common names during that time
- If the gospels were fabricated stories, they wouldn't have use women as witnesses of Jesus' resurrection. (It would be like using kids as eye witness in a court room)
- There were embarassing account of the apostles. "Doubting Thomas", they all deserted Jesus, Peter denied Jesus 3 times after saying he would die for Him
### Hasn't Science Disprove Christianity?
- Robert Boyle was devout Christian
- The scientific method was developed by Christians (friars) , Roger Bacon, William of Ockham. Francis Bacon established and popularized it.
- Oxford, Cambride, Harvard, and Yale first came about as institute to train pastors
- A theist world view sees the world as creation of God, who has made it with order and design. And can only be understood through empirical means
- Galileo's idea that the earth revolved around the sun; the catholic church persecuted that idea
	- Galileo was a Christian
	- The view that the universe revolved around earth came from Aristotle
- Christian Scienctists
	- Issac Newton, law of motion; denies the diety of Christ but none the less believed in God
	- Michael Faraday, electromagnitism
	- James Clerk Maxwell, evangelical prysbeterian
	- Lord Kalvin, president of Christian Evidence Society
	- Gregor Mendel, Roman Catholic friar
- Big Bang vs Steady State theory
- Modern Christian Scientists (MIT)
	- Rosalind Picard
	- Troy Van Voorhis
	- Linda Griffith
	- Dick Yue
	- Chris Love
	- Doug Lauffenburger
	- Anne McCants
	- Susan Hockfield
- Francis Collin who leads the Human Genome Project
- Science doesn't give us meaning to life. It tells us about process, the how but it doesn't tell us the *why*.
- Christianity tells us that we are more than just cells and atoms. We are valued, because we are made in the image of God.
- Replay the tape and the result would be different (Evolution and that human are not divinely designed)
	- There seems to be randomness in the design of the human body(larygneal nurve)
	- In history there seems to be randomness, chance and mishaps. But in the Christian perspective we see that was orchestration in the background and it ultimately led to his redemptive plan of sending His Son on the cross. So a Christian would believe that God is in control despite randomness, or mishaps.
	- Simon Conway Morris, believe that "replaying the tape and the result would be different" might not be the best science
- Some atheism say that human have a tendency to believe in religion because human have a tendency to see a rock in tiger shape and assume it is an actual tiger. It's better to be safe than sorry. Bring this to a bigger level, and you get people believing in God. (Imputing Agency)
	- "If. there is a God with whom we are meant to be in a personal relationship, then how probable is it that engagement in such a relationship would happen to be good for us?" Justin L. Barret
- Fine Tuning
	- By Chance
	- Created by a God who desired it to sustain life
	- There are multiverses and ours just happen to be able to sustain life
- *The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences* - Eugene Wigner

## Doesn't Christianity Denigrate Women?
- God made man and women for a reason. He could have created us asexual.
- Men would be able to demonstrate how God is a Father
	- [[../../Isa 49#15|Isa 49:15]], might also show how God can be like a mother
- God created both man and women in His image.
	- perhaps, man can't image God alone since God is love
	- God created man to be very good, but is it not good that man be alone
		- "helper" can also refer to God (Holy Spirit), so it doesn't not imply inferior
	- Man and women joined as one flesh, different but united in marriage as God is 3 in 1.
- The fall of man, resulted in the curse in the relationship between man and women. [[../../Gen 3#16|Gen 3:16]], *desire*, to possess as in [[../../Gen 4#7|Gen 4:7]]
- [[../../Isa 54#5|Isa 54:5]], covenant of God is pictured like a marriage and God is always the husband
	- But God's people, always acts as unfaithful wife. How can a holy and faithful God live with sinful people?
- Jesus being the fulfillment of the Old Testament is the bride groom to the people of God
- Luke highlights a lot of Jesus' interaction and elevated value of women in their time, and contracted with men in negative light 
	- the prophettests in the beginning
	- Parable of the lost coin
	- The Samaritan women
	- The Bleeding women
	- The persistent widow
	- The women who followed Jesus since the start of His ministry
	- Mary and Martha
	- The women who weeped at Jesus' feet
- [[../../Ephes 5|Ephesians 5]], wives are called to submit to their husband as to the Lord.
	- Need to take in context that, husband are to love their wives as Christ loved the Church (Suffering and Sacrifice, died for the church)
	- In that context, it's not that bad that wives are to submit to a sacrificing husband
	- Marriage is a picture of how Christ loved the church, and how the church submits and receives Christ's sacrifice
- Jesus as example of the perfect man, His view of women and how He treated women is our example
- the early church elevated women to the point that the greco-roman world felt disgust
- commitment rather than unlimited choice leads to more happiness. Loss commitment also decreases happiness

## Isn't Christianity Homophobic?
- Marriage is not the only way to be "one flesh" or intimate
	- The bible describes the church as one body, with Christ as the head (friendship)
	- Jesus was single, and His love was the greatest of all ([[../../John 15#13|John 15:13]])
	- Friendship intimacy is inclusive, while marriage intimacy is exclusive
- There are benefits in having boundaries in relationships.
- Of all the issues that the early church faced in Acts, loneliness was not one of them
- Christians are called to carry their cross and follow Christ. Following Jesus means limiting your sexual freedom, either you are heterosexual or homosexual. But in ways you gains something more. Knowing Christ is better [[../../Phil 3#8|Phil 3:8]]
- The bible is very clear that homosexuality is a sin
	- [[../../Lev 18#22|Lev 18:22]], [[../../Lev 20#13|Lev 20:13]]
	- Jesus actually made the OT law concerning sexuality strickter
	- [[../../Matt 19#2|Matt 19:2-9]], Man and a Women shall be one flesh.
		- Whoever lust over a women have committed adultery
		- if you eye causes you to sin, gauge it out [[../../Matt 5#29|Matt 5:29]]
	- Paul also condemns homosexuality but he does not place himself on a moral high ground ([[../../1 Tim 1#15|1 Tim 1:15]]), we are all sinners needing of God's grace
		- [[../../1 Tim 1#9|1 Tim 1:9-10]], [[../../1 Cor 6#9|1 Cor 6:9]]
	- Homosexuality as stemming from idolatry [[../../Rom 1#26|Rom 1:26-27]]
- Westerners are far more likely to affirm homosexuality than people of color. Assuming every one not condoning homosexuality to be bigoted or backward is not promoting diversity and tolerance.
- You may not be able to choose your sexual orientation, but you can choose what you do with it
- Intersex, exception to the rule but the Bible is clear on homosexuality. Tricky. Our identity is first and foremost in Christ, and every thing else flow out of that.

- [[../../Matt 19#11|Matt 19:11-12]], there are those born unable to reproduce or choose to not marry. They are still immensely valuable
- [[../../Matt 22#30|Matt 22:30]], there will be no marriage in heaven. In the end those who chose Jesus over marriage or sexual fulfillment will not have missed out.

## Doesn't the Bible Condone Slavery
- Description is not prescription, after Genesis 3 the world is corrupt with sin
	- God was not pleased with what happened with Abraham and Hagar
- Slavery in ancient middle east
	- it was not based on race (Joseph, and Hagar)
	- people often sold themself into slavery as a form of employment, it was better than destitution
	- advancement is possible as a slavery (Joseph)
- The people of Israel themselves was slave in egypt
	- And the story is that God saved his people from slavery
	- God reminds his people that they were slaves and set rules on how they should treat slaves
		- [[../../Deut 21#10|Deut 21:10-14]][[../../Deut 23#15|Deut 23:15]][[../../Deut 15#12|Deut 15:12-16]][[../../Exod 21#2|Exod 21:2]][[../../Exod 20#26|Exod 20:26]][[../../Exod 20#10|Exod 20:10]][[../../Exod 21#16|Exod 21:16]]
		- Some abhorrent to us, but at that time it greatly valued slaves
- Paul's letter to Onismus
	- Sending Philemon back as a son, appeal to Onismus to treat him as Paul himself.
	- in the Roman world, this is vastly different (branding, breaking of bones, etc..)
- Jesus as slave ([[../../Matt 20#26|Matt 20:26-28]], [[../../John 13#13|John 13:13-14]], [[../../Phil 2#5|Phil 2:5-8]])
- Christians as slave 
	- Slave was described as belonging to someone, Christians belongs to Christ
	- [[../../1 Cor 6#19|1 Cor 6:19-20]], [[../../Col 4#12|Col 4:12]], [[../../Col 4#7|Col 4:7]], [[../../Titus 1#1|Titus 1:1]], [[../../Phil 1#1|Phil 1:1]], [[../../Rom 1#1|Rom 1:1]]
	- Paul purposely calls the one person we know to be an actual slave "our faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you" [[../../Col 4#9|Col 4:9]] without any slavery language
- Slaves as Christians
	- NT insists that slaves are equal and free ([[../../Gal 3#28|Gal 3:28]], [[../../Col 3#11|Col 3:11]], [[../../1 Cor 12#13|1 Cor 12:13]])
	- Slaves were to serve their master as to the Lord, and the master have to treat their slaves in regards to the Lord (who is master over them) ([[../../Col 3#22|Col 3:22-24]]
	- Slaves were encouraged to purchased their freedom if possible ([[../../1 Cor 7#12|1 Cor 7:12]])
- Though the NT does not condemn slavery itself. It has basically condemns all the elements of it that was bad, mistreatment, bondage, exploitation, coercion, superiority. But brotherhood and shared identify. Which will naturally lead abolition.
- In the 4th century, Greogry of Nyssa attacked the notion of slavery (Augustine, John CHrysostom)
	- They were able to ban sex slaves in the the Roman world
	- Ebb and flow of slavery and then the practice coming back (but often it was Christians who spoke out against it)
- Christians who practiced slavery were hypocrite
- Jonathan Edward owned slaves, though he condemned the slave trade and was one of the first to allow church membership to black christians
- Key Christian Slavery Abolitionist
	- Charles Spurgeon
	- John Wesley
	- *Uncle Tom's Cabin*
	- David Walker
	- Fredrick Douglas
	- Henry Highland Garnet
	- Harriet Tubman
- The miracle of black churches


## How Could a Loving God Allow so Much Suffering?
- Explore 3 perspectives
	- Suffering without God
	- Suffering with Buddhism
	- Suffering with Christianity

### Suffering without God
Suffering without God, then there is no meaning. Self is an illusion, there is not meaning to life. 
- Why do we still lament and have empathy for others?

### Buddhism's approach to suffering
- Buddhism's solution to suffering is detachment
- But study have found that those that seems to be living in undesirable circumstances live can happy lives
	- They can still live life with meaning

### Suffering from the Christian Perspective
- [[../../John 11|John 11]], Lazarus' death
	- [[../../John 11#25|John 11:25-26]], in our grief out greatest need is to have Jesus
	- [[../../John 11#35|John 11:35]], Jesus is there in our suffering.
		- [[../../Isa 53#3|Isa 53:3-5]]
	- Jesus later resurrects Lazarus. But why didn't He do it earlier?
		- Jesus wants Martha and Mary to know Him through their suffering
- Paul asked for God to remove his throne
- Jesus prayed "let this cup be taken from me, but not my will but yours be done". None the less the went to the cross
- Suffering is not a punishment for sin (not proportional to how much one sins)
	- [[../../Job|Job]], [[../../John 9#2|John 9:2-3]]
	- As opposed to Buddhism with Karma and Reincarnation, where an easy life means you have been good in the previous
	- [[../../The Parable of Lazarus and the Rich Young Ruler|Lazarus and the Rich Young Ruler]]
		- Instead the bible teaches that those who have an easier life will have a hard life in the next world, and those who have an hard life will have an easy life in the next
- God's love for us doesn't mean He does not intend for us to suffer
	- Jesus died and suffered on the cross
- For a Christian, there is always hope at the end of the story, and there is intimacy with God the creator
- Perhaps, if Adam and Eve never sinned then they would only know God as creator and Lord.
	- But though the redemptive history, mankind would know God as: Saviour, Lover, Husband, Head, Brother, Fellow Sufferer, and their Resurrection and their Life
	- Suffering allows us to know God more intimately
	- Man and creation was good, but it was not the best [[../../Gen 2#18|Gen 2:18]]
- Christ came to suffer and be with sufferers. This affects Christian ethics that we are to care and be with sufferers

## How Could A Loving God Send People to Hell?
- we humans have moral agency and are accountable for our actions
- If human have no moral agency, then people aren't accountable for the "wrongs" they done, then there also isn't moral bravery for trying to do the "right" thing
- all human are capable of great evil, and most of our relationships hinges on hiding
- we all desire to be known and loved, but there are places in us that are not lovable
- God knows us deeply, and still loves us. [[../../Luke 15#11|Luke 15:11-32]]
- But how can a just and good God love sinners and be in relation with them?
- God's wrath and anger, stems from His love
- Heaven and Hell isn't primary a place. Heaven is the blessing of full relationship with Jesus. While Hell is full separation from Jesus.
	- If you keep rejecting Christ now, one day that offer will be gone and the door will be closed on you.
- Sam Harris argues that there is no free will and the worst of criminals are affected by their circumstances, we should have more empathy for them. Christian are also called to emphasize with the worse criminals not because they're are innocent, but because we too are guilty
