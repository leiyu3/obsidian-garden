There are three types of OT Laws:
1. Ceremonial Law
2. Moral Law
3. Cultural Law???


The Law was given to the Israelites through Moses.

Romans talks a lot about the law
- If one perfectly follows the law then they are not under God's wrath. But all have fallen short.

#### Everything in the OT Law can be broken down into two parts
- How we react and correspond to God
- how we react and correspond to Men
