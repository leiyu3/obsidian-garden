## Who are the audience of the Parable?
- A Scribe asked the question "Who are my neighbors" iirc
- The man instead wanted to look good in front of the crowd and ask "Who are my neighbours?"
	- tries to justify himself

## Who are the characters of the Parable?
- Priest: a religious person who knows the OT law.
    - The one we most expect to help the men
    - Think that he is already good enough
- Levite: a little bit lower than the priest but they still know the OT law
- Samaritan:
    - felt compassion the moment he saw him
    - How many of us today can look at other and just feel compassion?
    - he gets naked to help a naked men, he pours out oil and wine
    - he has to walk, risk his safety
    - stayed with him all day
    - pays two denarii (a day worth of wages)
    - if he wants anything else, buy it and I'll pay it
    - Doesn't make any sense

## What is the point of the Parable?

- Samaritan was the good neighbour
- **Love everybody like that samaritan**
    - every person you meet
    - all their needs
    - and love God
- **It doesn't matter who you love**
- **It matte the quality of your love**
- Have you loved someone just like how the Samaritan loved that Jew?
    - Yourself
- You can't do it. You need Jesus to help you.
    - The priest who thought he can work his way up
- God saw us and felt compassion

- Where are we going? Too busy about life and forgot where we will go after death (v25)
-> [[./Old Testament Laws#Everything in the OT Law can be broken down into two parts|Old Testament Laws > Everything in the OT Law can be broken down into two parts]]

- To get eternal life we have to do this perfectly but we can't
- Jesus wants the men to realize that he can not and to ask Him for help

## Potential Bible Study Question
1. What has the Samaritan done to love this man?
2. Why do you think the Priest and Levite did nothing?
3. Do you think if you walk out of this room. Knowing how you are to love people, do you think that you can do it?
